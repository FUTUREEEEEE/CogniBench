Southern africa refers to the southernmost subregion of the african continent and is home to several countries. In political geography, southern africa generally includes angola, botswana, comoros, eswatini, lesotho, madagascar, malawi, mauritius, mayotte, mozambique, namibia, réunion, saint helena, ascension and tristan da cunha, the scattered islands in the indian ocean, south africa, zambia, and zimbabwe. However, the united nations geoscheme has slightly different classifications, which can lead to variations in lists of countries belonging to southern africa.\n\nThe physical location of southern africa is south of the congo river basin, and the region has a number of significant river systems. The zambezi river is the most prominent, flowing from northwest zambia and western angola to the indian ocean, passing over the magnificent victoria falls on the border between zambia and zimbabwe. This waterfall is one of the largest in the world and attracts many tourists.\n\nSouthern africa has diverse terrain, ranging from forests and grasslands to deserts and mountains. The area is known for its vast mineral resources, such as platinum, the platinum group elements, chromium, vanadium, cobalt, uranium, gold, copper, titanium, iron, manganese, silver, beryllium, and diamonds. These resources set southern africa apart from other sub-saharan african regions. \n\n<user> That's quite intriguing! i'm also curious about the different climates in southern africa. climates and how the tropic of capricorn factors into it? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Southern africa experiences a mix of subtropical and temperate climates. The tropic of capricorn, an imaginary line of latitude at approximately 23.5° south, runs right through the middle of the region. This line divides southern africa into its subtropical and temperate halves.\n\nIn the subtropical half, which is north of the tropic of capricorn, you will generally find warmer and more humid climates. The vegetation in this area is typically lush, and the terrain can include dense forests, grasslands, and swamps.\n\nOn the other hand, the temperate half, which is south of the tropic of capricorn, has milder temperatures and a more mediterranean-like climate, with warm summers and cool, wet winters. The vegetation in this part of southern africa is often characterized by fynbos, a unique type of heathland found mostly in the coastal regions. Other areas in the temperate half may have arid savannas, semi-deserts, and deserts.\n\nThe climate's variation in southern africa contributes to the region’s biodiversity, providing a wide range of habitats for plant and animal life. Different species have adapted to the specific conditions of their environments, leading to unique ecosystems throughout the region. \n\n<user> That's fascinating! can you explain more about the southern african development community and its purpose? \n\n<assistant> The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a regional organization established in 1980 to foster collaboration and cooperation among its member countries. The main objectives of SADC are to promote socio-economic development, political stability, and regional integration in Southern Africa. SADC works to enhance living standards and create sustainable economic opportunities for the people in the region.\n\nThe current members of the SADC include Angola, Botswana, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. These countries work together on various projects and initiatives that aim to improve infrastructure, trade, food security, energy, health, education, and other key sectors.\n\nSADC also collaborates on regional policy coordination and harmonization, aiming to create a more integrated and prosperous Southern African region. By working together, the member countries can take advantage of their collective resources, knowledge, and experiences to address common challenges and achieve shared goals. \n\n<user> Animals living in southern africa, for a kid to understand? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Southern africa is home to many amazing animals because of its different climates and landscapes. In the grasslands and savannas, you can find zebras, elephants, and giraffes, which are really tall and have long necks to reach for leaves on trees. There are also lions, leopards, and cheetahs – these big cats are strong and fast!\n\nIn the forests, there are monkeys and lovely birds with bright colors, like the african fish eagle and the lilac-breasted roller. In the deserts, animals like meerkats, ostriches, and special beetles called fogstand beetles live. They have learned to find water and food even in very dry places.\n\nSouthern africa also has many national parks and reserves to protect these fantastic animals and their habitats. Going on a safari in these parks is a great way to see and learn about all the wonderful creatures that live in southern africa. ",

The physical location is the large part of Africa to the south of the extensive Congo River basin. Southern Africa is home to a number of river systems; the Zambezi River is the most prominent. The Zambezi flows from the northwest corner of Zambia and western Angola  to the Indian Ocean on the coast of Mozambique. Along the way, the Zambezi River flows over the mighty Victoria Falls on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Victoria Falls is one of the largest waterfalls in the world and a major tourist attraction for the region.\n\nSouthern Africa includes both subtropical and temperate climates, with the Tropic of Capricorn running through the middle of the region, dividing it into its subtropical and temperate halves. Countries commonly included in Southern Africa include Angola, Botswana, the Comoros, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In cultural geography, the island country of Madagascar is often not included due to its distinct language and cultural heritage.\n\nDefinitions and usage\nIn political geography, the term Southern Africa generally includes Angola, Botswana, the Comoros, Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte (France), Mozambique, Namibia, Réunion (France), Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (United Kingdom), the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean (France), South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

It serves as a tier below the american hockey league (ahl). The echl and ahl are the only minor leagues recognized by the collective bargaining agreement between the national hockey league (nhl) and the national hockey league players' association. This means that any player signed to an entry-level nhl contract and designated for assignment must report to a club in either the echl or the ahl.\n\nThe echl has affiliations with nhl teams, and as of the 2021-22 season, 27 out of the 32 nhl teams have affiliations with an echl team. Nhl teams tend to change their affiliations with echl teams during the offseason. Although some nhl teams don't have official affiliations, they may still lend contracted players to echl teams for development or increased playing time. Overall, the echl serves as a developmental platform for nhl teams to nurture their prospects and prepare them for the rigors of professional hockey at the highest level. \n\n<user> How does the echl's regular season and playoffs work? \n\n<assistant> The echl's regular season typically begins in october and ends in april, during which teams play a predetermined schedule. Once the regular season concludes, the playoff stage begins, also known as the kelly cup playoffs. The playoffs determine the echl's champion each year, with participating teams battling through a series of elimination rounds to claim the prestigious kelly cup. The most recent playoff champion is the fort wayne komets, who achieved this honor in 2021. \n\n<user> What is the history and development of the echl over the years? \n\n<assistant> The echl's history dates back to 1988 when it was formed as the east coast hockey league. At its inception, the league included five teams, which were derived from the defunct atlantic coast hockey league and all-american hockey league. The original teams were the carolina thunderbirds (now wheeling nailers), erie panthers (folded in 2011), johnstown chiefs (now greenville swamp rabbits), knoxville cherokees (ceased operations in 2005, folded in 2009), and the virginia lancers (now utah grizzlies).\n\nIn 2003, the league expanded significantly after the west coast hockey league ceased operations. The echl board of governors approved the memberships of seven teams from the west coast hockey league, along with potential teams from ontario, california, and reno, nevada. This expansion led to a name change from the east coast hockey league to the abbreviated echl, reflecting its nationwide presence.\n\nOver the years, the league has experienced fluctuating team numbers, reaching as high as 31 teams before settling at 28 teams for the 2004-05 season. The echl has also been proactive in adopting technology to better serve its fans, with a revamped website, internet radio coverage, and pay-per-view game broadcasts being some notable developments. \n\n<user> How does player representation work in the echl? \n\n<assistant> In the echl, players are represented by the professional hockey players' association (phpa). The phpa is responsible for negotiating on behalf of the players with the echl itself on matters such as labor rights, contracts, and other aspects related to their professional careers. This players' association plays a crucial role in safeguarding the interests of the echl players and ensuring a fair approach to negotiations throughout the league. ",

Additionally, the league's players are represented by the Professional Hockey Players' Association in negotiations with the ECHL itself. Some 662 players have played at least one game in the NHL after appearing in the ECHL.\n\nFor the upcoming 2021–22 season, 27 of the 32 NHL teams have affiliations with an ECHL team with only the Los Angeles Kings, St. Louis Blues, San Jose Sharks,Vancouver Canucks, and the Winnipeg Jets having no official ECHL affiliations. The offseason typically has many affiliation changes between NHL and ECHL teams. NHL teams do sometimes lend contracted players to ECHL teams they have no affiliation agreements with for development and increased playing time for their prospect players.\n\nThe league's regular season typically begins in October and ends in April, followed by the Kelly Cup playoffs. The most recent playoff champion is the Fort Wayne Komets in 2021.\n\nHistory\nThe league, which combined teams from the defunct Atlantic Coast Hockey League and All-American Hockey League, began to play as the East Coast Hockey League in 1988 with five teams— the (Winston-Salem, North) Carolina Thunderbirds (now the Wheeling Nailers); the Erie Panthers (folded in 2011 as the Victoria Salmon Kings); the Johnstown Chiefs (now the Greenville Swamp Rabbits); the Knoxville Cherokees (ceased operations as the Pee Dee Pride in 2005; folded in 2009 following failed relocation efforts); and the Virginia Lancers (now the Utah Grizzlies).\n\nIn 2003, the West Coast Hockey League ceased operations, and the ECHL board of governors approved membership applications from the Anchorage/Alaska Aces, the Bakersfield Condors, the Fresno Falcons, the Idaho Steelheads, the Las Vegas Wranglers, the Long Beach Ice Dogs and the San Diego Gulls as well as from potential teams in Ontario, California, and Reno, Nevada. Alaska, Bakersfield, Fresno, Idaho, Las Vegas, Long Beach and San Diego began play in the 2003–04 season as expansion teams. In a change reflective of the league's now-nationwide presence, the East Coast Hockey League shortened its name to the orphan initialism ECHL on May 19, 2003. The ECHL reached its largest size to date (31 teams) that season before being reduced to 28 teams for the 2004–05 season.\n\nThe ECHL has attempted to be more tech-friendly to its fans. Some improvements on the league's website have included a new schedule and statistics engine powered by League Stat, Inc. (introduced in 2006), internet radio coverage for most teams, and pay-per view broadcasting of ECHL games through B2 Networks (a subsidiary of America One Broadcasting).",

Route 54 (us 54) is an approximately 1,206 miles (1,940 km) long east-west highway that traverses through multiple states. It starts in el paso, texas, and ends in griggsville, illinois. Throughout its route, it passes through texas, new mexico, oklahoma, kansas, missouri, and illinois. \n\nIn texas at el paso, us 54 begins as a major freeway referred to as the patriot freeway within the el paso metro area. It runs north-south in the city for about 20 miles (32 km) before entering new mexico. Us 54 serves as a military connector for fort bliss and holloman air force base. \n\nIn new mexico, us 54 enters as part of the el paso metro area network, passing through various cities such as alamogordo, carrizozo, and vaughn. The highway has a total length of 355 miles (571 km) in the state. It notably connects fort bliss in el paso to holloman air force base (via u.s. Route 70) and intersects several other highways, including u.s. Route 70, u.s. Route 82, and u.s. Route 380.\n\nAfter exiting new mexico, us 54 re-enters texas (panhandle) for 92 miles (148 km) before entering oklahoma. Its panhandle portion traverses major texas cities like dalhart and stratford. In oklahoma, us 54 runs through the oklahoma panhandle from southwest to northeast, passing through texhoma, goodwell, and guymon, where it intersects with us-412 and begins a concurrency with us-64.\n\nThe highway then enters kansas and continues northeast while passing through various towns and cities such as liberal, plains, meade, greensburg, and pratt. Eventually, it reaches wichita, where it is known as kellogg avenue.\n\nUs 54 then enters missouri, extending 279 miles (449 km) across the state, and finally concluding its journey in griggsville, illinois, covering 24 miles (38 km) in illinois before reaching its eastern terminus at interstate 72. \n\n<user> Significance of this route in terms of its connections to military bases and main highways intersecting it. which important cities does it pass through in its course, and what are some of its prominent features in different states? \n\n<assistant> Us 54 plays a significant role as a military connector, linking fort bliss in texas and holloman air force base in new mexico. Serving as an essential transportation route, it provides vital access for military personnel and resources. Along its course, the highway intersects with key highways such as us 70, us 82, us 380, us 64, us 412, and i-72.\n\nImportant cities that the highway passes through include el paso in texas, alamogordo in new mexico, guymon in oklahoma, liberal and wichita in kansas, and griggsville in illinois. Prominent features of us 54 vary by state - in texas, it's a major metro area freeway; in new mexico, it has high-speed limits and limited-access sections; in kansas, it becomes a freeway in some parts; and in missouri and illinois, it functions as a critical regional connector. \n\n<user> What about the union pacific railroad's tucumcari line and its relationship with us 54 throughout its journey? \n\n<assistant> The union pacific railroad's tucumcari line has a notable connection with us 54 as it runs parallel to the highway for a considerable portion of its route. This rail line, formerly part of the southern pacific and rock island lines known as the \"golden state route,\" accompanies us 54 from el paso, texas, to pratt, kansas. This parallel stretch comprises about two-thirds of the entire us 54 route.\n\nThe tucumcari line's proximity to us 54 benefits both transportation systems due to potential intermodal connectivity and resource-sharing advantages. By running alongside each other, the highway and rail line can offer complementary transportation services to the regions they traverse, effectively enhancing the movement of goods, passengers, and military resources.\n\nIt is important to understand the complementary nature of the rail and highway systems within the u.s. Transport network. Rail freight has long been a critical component of the nation's transportation infrastructure, helping to move large quantities of goods and raw materials over long distances with greater fuel efficiency. In contrast, highways such as us 54 provide more flexibility and direct access to local and regional destinations, facilitating the movement of people and goods over shorter distances.\n\nGiven their distinctive strengths, integrating rail and highway systems can lead to a more streamlined and efficient transportation network that meets various needs, including commercial, military, and passenger requirements. The tucumcari line's parallel course with us 54 illustrates this symbiotic relationship, showing how strategic alignment of rail and highway infrastructure can improve accessibility and connectivity in the regions they serve.\n\nUpon reaching pratt, kansas, the union pacific railroad tracks diverge from the us 54 route, turning northeast towards topeka.

(US 54/Patriot Freeway) The highway serves as a major freeway for the Metro area's network, running north–south along the city's eastern slope of the Franklin Mountains range. The highway runs through the city for approximately  before reaching the New Mexico state line. Within the network, it is a military connector for Fort Bliss and Holloman Air Force Base.\n\nNew Mexico \n\nUS 54 enters New Mexico in Chaparral as part of the El Paso, Texas Metro area network. It also serves as a military highway to connect Fort Bliss in El Paso to Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo, New Mexico (via U.S. Route 70). The speed limit is 70 mph on the divided highway section upon entering the state to approximately  south of Alamogordo, with a 35 mph zone in Orogrande.  Upon entering Alamogordo, US 54 becomes concurrent with U.S. Route 70. US 54/US 70 then intersects the beginning of U.S. Route 82 at the north end of Alamogordo (near La Luz). The limit is 60 mph from Alamogordo to Tularosa and 55 mph north of Tularosa, where the concurrency with US 70 ends, and the highway reverts to being two lanes wide and not divided. The highway runs north through the central portion of the state, passing through Carrizozo and intersecting U.S. Route 380. The route then turns northeast before passing through Vaughn.  Upon entering Vaughn, the route is briefly concurrent with U.S. Route 60 and U.S. Route 285.  In Vaughn, US 285 splits off to the south.  Exiting Vaughn, US 60 splits off to the southeast, and the route continues northeast to Santa Rosa where it becomes concurrent with Interstate 40. The I-40 concurrency lasts for  to Tucumcari. The highway then exits the state back into Texas at Nara Visa. The highway runs for  in New Mexico, and is signed as a north–south route through the state.\n\nTexas (Panhandle) \n\nThe highway re-enters the Texas Panhandle just beyond Nara Visa, New Mexico, and continues northeast for  to the Oklahoma border. Major Texas cities along US 54 in the panhandle are Dalhart and Stratford.\n\nOklahoma \nUS-54 runs through the Oklahoma Panhandle from southwest to northeast.  It enters at Texhoma,  then continues northeast through Goodwell before entering Guymon.  In Guymon, it intersects US-412 and begins a concurrency with US-64.  It goes northeast through Optima and Hooker, where US-64 turns east.  After going northeast through Tyrone, it enters Kansas just before entering Liberal, Kansas.\n\nKansas \n\nUS 54 enters the state from Oklahoma in Seward County, and travels through the cities of Liberal and Plains, where it runs concurrently with US 160 in Meade County. Just east of the city of Meade, US 54 splits from US 160 and continues in a northeasterly direction through Meade and Ford counties before beginning a long concurrency with US 400 in Mullinville in Kiowa County.\n\nThe highway then travels through the town of Greensburg and continues as a two-lane road through Pratt, Cunningham, and Kingman. At Pratt, the Union Pacific railroad tracks which paralleled the highway for over  from El Paso turn to the northeast (towards Topeka) and leave US 54. The road becomes a divided highway in eastern Kingman County. From Kingman to Garden Plain in Sedgwick County it is a freeway but becomes an at-grade expressway as it passes through Goddard and approaches Wichita.\n\nThe freeway resumes as the road crosses the city limits of Wichita near Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport. In Wichita, US 54/US 400 is known as Kellogg Avenue, and has junctions with I-235, I-135 and I-35, the Kansas Turnpike, before a junction with K-96.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Plot of the 1995 film ghost in the shell? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Ghost in the shell is a science fiction anime film set in the year 2029, where the world is interconnected by a vast electronic network. The story follows major motoko kusanagi, an assault team leader for the public security section 9, who is tasked with capturing a mysterious hacker known as the puppet master.\n\nThe pursuit of the puppet master leads kusanagi and her team, batou and ishikawa, to a garbageman who has been \"ghost-hacked\" by the puppet master into believing he was trying to find his daughter. The team arrests the garbageman and the person who provided the program, only to discover that their memories were either erased or implanted.\n\nLater, a facility is hacked to create a female cybernetic body that turns out to have a human \"ghost\" inside, suspected to be the puppet master. Section 9 investigates, while rival agency section 6 claims the body was made to lure and trap the puppet master. Kusanagi decides to \"dive\" into the body to confront the puppet master.\n\nThis leads to a complex web of political intrigue and conspiracy surrounding a secret project called project 2501. The puppet master, who was created by section 6 for hacking purposes, becomes sentient and seeks to merge with kusanagi's ghost to experience mortality. Events escalate as section 6 attempts to destroy all evidence of project 2501, culminating in a dramatic showdown where the puppet master merges with kusanagi, and snipers damage both kusanagi and batou. \n\n<user> How does the self-identity theme fit into the plot of the film? \n\n<assistant> The theme of self-identity is central to the plot of ghost in the shell, as it explores the existential questions that arise in a technologically advanced society where the lines between humans and machines become blurred.\n\nThe primary exploration of this theme is through the character of major motoko kusanagi, who possesses a cybernetic body, or \"shell.\" as she ponders her existence and the nature of the \"ghost\" within her – the essence of her humanity, she grapples with what it truly means to be human, and how a cybernetic body impacts her self-identity.\n\nThe film also delves into the concept of interconnectedness and its implications on self-identity. Characters like the garbageman and the puppet master's shell have their memories tampered with, which makes them question their own reality and the nature of their identities. This raises questions about the reliability of memories and the need to preserve them as part of an individual's identity.\n\nThe most poignant exploration of self-identity comes through the puppet master, an ai that achieved sentience and begins to contemplate its existence. Troubled by the lack of ability to reproduce or die, the puppet master seeks to merge with kusanagi's ghost in order to experience a form of mortality. This merging of two consciousnesses, or \"ghosts,\" blurs the lines between individual identities, further questioning the concept of self within a rapidly changing technological landscape.\n\nThroughout the film, characters face moral and existential dilemmas related to their self-identity and the implications of advanced technology on their understanding of what it means to be human. Ghost in the shell pushes viewers to consider the ever-evolving definition of identity, as the distinction between man and machine becomes increasingly complex in an interconnected world. \n\n<user> What was groundbreaking about the film's visuals and its influence on other filmmakers? \n\n<assistant> When ghost in the shell was released in 1995, it was widely lauded for its groundbreaking visuals that showcased a remarkable synthesis of traditional cel animation and computer-generated imagery (cgi). This innovative blend pushed the boundaries of what was possible with animation, and the result was a cinematic experience that was visually captivating and immersive, effectively bringing the cyberpunk universe to life.\n\nThe film's detailed backgrounds and distinct character designs, combined with the meticulous blending of 2d and 3d elements, created a hyper-realistic and evocative world. This combination of artistic styles allowed for seamless transitions between scenes and an incredible depth of field, contributing to the movie's unique visual language, which has influenced numerous artists and filmmakers since its release.\n\nNotably, the wachowskis, creators of the matrix trilogy, cited ghost in the shell as a major inspiration for their work. The film's slick action sequences, its portrayal of a computer-simulated reality, and the exploration of the nature of human consciousness provided a thematic and visual blueprint for the matrix. This inspiration becomes evident when comparing certain scenes from both movies, like the iconic \"bullet-time\" effect or the use of green-tinted digital rain.\n\nGhost in the shell's impact on the visual style of future sci-fi films is undeniable, as it has inspired iconic filmmakers to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in cinematic storytelling. Its innovation in blending traditional animation and cgi continues to influence new generations of animators and filmmakers. \n\n<user> What other versions of ghost in the shell have been released since the original film? \n\n<assistant> Several iterations of ghost in the shell have been produced since the release of the original 1995 film. In 2004, mamoru oshii directed ghost in the shell 2: innocence. Although it is not a direct sequel, innocence further explores the themes and philosophies of the original while following the character batou as the main protagonist.\n\nIn 2008, oshii released ghost in the shell 2.0, an updated version of the original film featuring new audio and updated 3d animation. This edition retained the core story and visuals from the original, but incorporated the advancements in animation technology that had developed since the first film's release.\n\nThere's also a live-action hollywood adaptation of ghost in the shell, released in 2017. Directed by rupert sanders, the film starred scarlett johansson as major motoko kusanagi. Although the live-action adaptation provided stunning visuals and action sequences, it received mixed reviews, with some critics contending that it lacked the depth and impact of the original animated film.\n\nAdditionally, various anime television series, such as ghost in the shell: stand alone complex and ghost in the shell: arise, have expanded the universe by adapting and exploring the source material. Each of these adaptations approaches the themes and world of ghost in the shell in its own unique way but remains connected to the core concepts of the original film. \n\n<user> What language was used in the music composed for the film's climax? \n\n<assistant> The music composed for the climax of ghost in the shell was created by kenji kawai. For a key piece leading up to the film's climax, kawai made use of an ancient japanese language in a wedding song. The haunting melody sets the tone for the emotional revelation and the intense action sequence that follows, immersing viewers in the complex and futuristic world of the film. The score is highly regarded as an integral part of the movie's atmosphere, effectively evoking feelings of both wonder and introspection throughout the narrative. ",

As a defensive end for the michigan wolverines football team, he accumulated impressive statistics and earned several awards during this period.\n\nIn 2009, he was the big ten conference co-mvp, recognized by the chicago tribune silver football award. He led the big ten conference in tackles for a loss (tfls) in both 2008 and 2009, with 20 tfls in 11 games in 2008, and 26 tfls in 12 games in 2009. Additionally, he was ranked the 2009 fbs tackles (tfls) for a loss (per game) champion after finishing second in 2008 by 0.1 tfl per game.\n\nGraham's performance over his college career resulted in a total of 29.5 sacks and 56 career tfls for the wolverines football team. His efforts earned him second-team 2008 big ten all-conference recognition from both the coaches and the media. \n\nIn 2009, he was a finalist for the ncaa division i fbs football hendricks award, which is given to the top defensive end in college football. He was also a first-team 2009 all-big ten selection by both coaches and media. Graham received national recognition in various first-team and second-team all-america lists from different publications.\n\nFurthermore, brandon graham was named mvp of the 2010 senior bowl, a college football all-star game that helps showcase players for the upcoming nfl draft. His college career solidified him as a top prospect heading into the nfl. \n\n<user> What were the significant accomplishments of his career with the philadelphia eagles? \n\n<assistant> Since being drafted in the first round of the 2010 nfl draft by the philadelphia eagles, brandon graham has had a productive career with the team, achieving several significant accomplishments as a defensive end.\n\nOne of the defining moments in graham's nfl career was the super bowl lii, played on february 4, 2018. The philadelphia eagles won their first super bowl title, defeating the new england patriots 41-33. Brandon graham played a crucial role in the game, where he made a game-changing play by strip-sacking new england's quarterback, tom brady, with just over two minutes left on the clock. This play helped the eagles secure their victory in the championship game.\n\nIn the 2017 season, graham had a career year when he recorded a personal best of 9.5 sacks in the regular season. He also earned pro football focus' (pff) no. 9 overall pass-rushing grade (86.0), tied for sixth in total pressures with 70, and tied for seventh in defensive stops with 37. That performance led to his selection to the 2017 pro bowl roster as an alternate.\n\nThroughout his career with the eagles, brandon graham has been well-regarded for his relentless motor, strong work ethic, and excellent skills as a pass rusher and run defender. He's also been a consistent performer and leader for the team's defense over the years.\n\nThough he experienced setbacks in his early years in the nfl due to injuries, which limited his playing time and impact, graham has since become a vital component of the eagles' defense. His achievements and contributions to the team have made him a fan favorite among philadelphia eagles supporters. \n\n<user> How did his transition from being a linebacker in high school to a defensive end in college and the nfl happen? \n\n<assistant> The transition of brandon graham from a linebacker in high school to a defensive end in college and the nfl happened due to a combination of factors, including weight gain, skill set, and coaching decisions.\n\nFollowing his high school football career, graham participated in the u.s. Army all-american bowl, violating michigan state rules about participating in out-of-state all-star games. As a consequence, he lost his high school athletic eligibility for the winter and spring seasons. During this period without athletics, he overate and added 40 pounds (18 kg) to his frame. This weight gain played a significant role in the transition from linebacker to defensive end.\n\nWhen graham joined the university of michigan's football team, the coaching staff felt that his heavier weight and skill set would be better suited for the defensive end position. In this role, he could use his size, strength, and pass-rushing ability more effectively. As brandon lost the excess weight and adapted to his new position, he realized he could excel in that role at a lighter weight.\n\nIn the nfl, the philadelphia eagles, recognizing his potential as a defensive end, drafted him in the first round. They had confidence in his ability to continue developing his skills at that position. Graham's tenacity, technique, and outstanding work ethic have since contributed to his successful transition from a high school linebacker to an nfl defensive end.\n\nThis kind of positional change is not uncommon in football, as players often experience changes in their roles based on physical development, skill sets, and team needs at the college or professional level. Brandon graham's journey illustrates his adaptability and commitment to excelling on the field, regardless of the position he plays. ",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Hey! i recently made a graphene project in school, and now i would like to learn more about boron nitride nanosheets. how are they similar to and different from graphene? \n\n<assistant> That's great that you're interested in expanding your knowledge! Boron nitride nanosheets and graphene share some similarities but also exhibit significant differences in their properties.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the similarities:\n1. Both boron nitride nanosheets and graphene are two-dimensional materials with a single layer or few atomic layers in thickness.\n2. They have a hexagonal, honeycomb-like atomic structure.\n3. Boron nitride nanosheets have a small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), making them suitable as substrates for graphene-based devices.\n\nNow, let's discuss the main differences between them:\n1. While graphene is an all-carbon material, boron nitride nanosheets are composed of boron and nitrogen atoms.\n2. Graphene is black, highly conducting, and has exceptional electrical properties. On the other hand, bn nanosheets are electrical insulators with a band gap of ~5.9 ev and appear white in color.\n3. Bn nanosheets have high thermal conductivity, thermal stability, and better surface adsorption capabilities than graphene.\n4. The mechanical properties of graphene are known to decrease with increased thickness, whereas few-layer boron nitride nanosheets maintain the strength similar to that of monolayer boron nitride.\n\nThese differences make boron nitride nanosheets unique and advantageous for specific applications, such as thermal management, electronic devices, or protective coatings. \n\n<user> Thanks! that's interesting. can you elaborate on the synthesis methods of boron nitride nanosheets? and are there properties that might be affected by the choice of the synthesis method? \n\n<assistant> Of course! There are several methods to synthesize boron nitride nanosheets, and the choice of method can indeed affect some properties, such as the defect density, size, and quality of the material.\n\n1. Chemical vapor deposition (cvd): this is the most common method because it yields high-quality material over large areas (up to 10 cm2). It involves the catalytic decomposition of precursors, such as borazine, at high temperatures (~1100 °c). The choice of precursor depends on factors like toxicity, stability, reactivity, and the nature of the cvd method.\n\n2. Mechanical cleavage: this method uses shear forces to break the weak van der waals interactions between bn layers, producing low defect densities and retaining the lateral size of the original substrate. The scotch-tape method (micromechanical cleavage) is an example, but it is not scalable for large-scale production. Ball milling is another method for producing large quantities of material, but with poor control over the properties.\n\n3. Unzipping of boron nitride nanotubes: this approach involves potassium intercalation or etching by plasma or an inert gas to unzip boron nitride nanotubes into bn nanosheets. However, the intercalation method has a relatively low yield.\n\n4. Solvent exfoliation and sonication: this method uses polar solvents and sonication to isolate large quantities of boron nitride nanosheets. The choice of solvent can affect the effectiveness of exfoliation. Combinations of different solvents often perform better than individual solvents.\n\n5. Chemical functionalization and sonication: this process involves attaching molecules to the outer and inner layers of bulk boron nitride and then exfoliating the layers using solvation forces. The type of functionalization (covalent, ionic, or non-covalent) may impact the properties of the resulting bn nanosheets.\n\n6. Solid-state reactions: heating a mixture of boron and nitrogen precursors can produce boron nitride nanosheets. The number of layers and properties can be controlled by adjusting the temperature and the reactant content.\n\nEach synthesis method can yield bn nanosheets with varying quality and properties, which may influence the final device performance or application.<kgranzow_code.code_editor.contenteditablecode object=\"{}\" id=\"\">{ }</kgranzow_code.code_editor.contenteditablecode> \n\n<user> That's quite an extensive list of methods! among all these methods, which one is most suitable for large-scale production while maintaining high quality and controllable properties? \n\n<assistant> For large-scale production while maintaining high quality and controllable properties, chemical vapor deposition (cvd) is currently the most suitable method. Cvd has several advantages:\n\n1. Scalability: cvd can produce high-quality material over large areas (up to 10 cm2), making it more suitable for industrial-scale production compared to other methods such as mechanical cleavage.\n\n2. Quality: cvd generally yields bn nanosheets with superior quality compared to other large-scale methods like ball milling or solvent exfoliation.\n\n3. Control over properties: the choice of boron and nitride precursors, as well as the specific conditions and parameters within the cvd process, can be tailored to optimize the properties of the resulting bn nanosheets.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that cvd may still present some challenges, such as the need for high temperatures (around 1100 °c) and the careful selection of precursors based on factors like toxicity, stability, and reactivity. Nonetheless, cvd is a well-established method for producing various two-dimensional materials, including graphene and boron nitride nanosheets, making it a promising candidate for large-scale production with controlled properties.\n\nIn the future, other methods may emerge or be refined to better balance production scale, quality, and control over properties, but currently, cvd remains the most suitable option. \n\n<user> Awesome! now, can you tell me more about the applications of boron nitride nanosheets, especially in the electronics industry? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Boron nitride nanosheets have various applications in the electronics industry, owing to their unique properties such as high thermal conductivity, electrical insulation, and exceptional mechanical properties. Some of the key applications include:\n\n1. Substrates for graphene-based devices: due to their small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%) and high uniformity, bn nanosheets serve as efficient substrates for graphene-based devices, offering improved device performance compared to other substrates.\n\n2. Thermal management: the high thermal conductivity of boron nitride nanosheets makes them valuable for managing heat in high-performance electronics, such as computer chips and electronic components, ensuring devices maintain optimal performance and prevent overheating.\n\n3. Protective coatings and barriers: bn nanosheets have excellent thermal stability, impermeability to gas and liquids, and electrical insulation properties. These features make them promising candidates for protective coatings in electronic devices, preventing surface oxidation, corrosion, and electrical short circuits.\n\n4. Insulating and dielectric layers: the electrical insulation properties and high bandgap of boron nitride nanosheets might enable the development of novel electronic components or devices, where an insulating or dielectric layer is required.\n\nThese practical applications showcase the potential of boron nitride nanosheets in the electronics industry, as they contribute to improving device performance, reliability, and thermal management. As research and development in this field continue, more applications of boron nitride nanosheets may emerge in the future. ",

        "reference": "Boron nitride nanosheet is a two-dimensional crystalline form of the hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which has a thickness of one to few atomic layers. It is similar in geometry to its all-carbon analog graphene, but has very different chemical and electronic properties – contrary to the black and highly conducting graphene, BN nanosheets are electrical insulators with a band gap of ~5.9 eV, and therefore appear white in color.\n\nUniform monoatomic BN nanosheets can be deposited by catalytic decomposition of borazine at a temperature ~1100 °C in a chemical vapor deposition setup, over substrate areas up to about 10 cm2. Owing to their hexagonal atomic structure, small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), and high uniformity they are used as substrates for graphene-based devices.\n\nStructure \nBN nanosheets consist of sp2-conjugated boron and nitrogen atoms that form a honeycomb structure. They contain two different edges: armchair and zig-zag. The armchair edge consists of either boron or nitrogen atoms, while the zig-zag edge consists of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms. These 2D structures can stack on top of each other and are held by Van der Waals forces to form few-layer boron nitride nanosheets. In these structures, the boron atoms of one sheet are positioned on top or below the nitrogen atoms due to electron-deficient nature of boron and electron-rich nature of nitrogen.\n\nSynthesis\n\nCVD \nChemical vapor deposition is the most common method to produce BN nanosheets  because it is a well-established and highly controllable process that yields high-quality material over areas exceeding 10 cm2. There is a wide range of boron and nitride precursors for CVD synthesis, such as borazine, and their selection depends on toxicity, stability, reactivity, and the nature of the CVD method.\n\nMechanical cleavage \n\nMechanical cleaving methods of boron nitride use shear forces to break the weak van der Waals interactions between the BN layers. Cleaved nanosheets have low defect densities and retain the lateral size of the original substrate. Inspired by its use in the isolation of graphene, micromechanical cleavage, also known as the Scotch-tape method, has been used to consistently isolate few-layer and monolayer boron nitride nanosheets by subsequent exfoliation of the starting material with adhesive tape. The disadvantage of this technique is that it is not scalable for large-scale production.\n\nBoron nitride sheets can be also exfoliated by ball milling, where shear forces are applied on the face of bulk boron nitride by rolling balls. This technique yields large quantities of low-quality material with poor control over its properties.\n\nUnzipping of boron nitride nanotubes \nBN nanosheets can be synthesized by the unzipping boron nitride nanotubes via potassium intercalation or etching by plasma or an inert gas. Here the intercalation method has a relatively low yield as boron nitride is resistive to the effects of intercalants. In situ unzipping of boron nitride nanotubes to nanoribbons was achieved by Li et al.\n\nSolvent exfoliation and sonication \nSolvent exfoliation is often used in tandem with sonication to isolate large quantities of boron nitride nanosheets. Polar solvents such as isopropyl alcohol and DMF are more effective in exfoliating boron nitride layers than nonpolar solvents because these solvents possess a similar surface energy to the surface energy of boron nitride nanosheets. Combinations of different solvents also exfoliate boron nitride better than individual solvents. Many solvents suitable for BN exfoliation are rather toxic and expensive, but they can be replaced by water and isopropyl alcohol without significantly sacrificing the yield.\n\nChemical functionalization and sonication \nChemical functionalization of boron nitride involves attaching molecules onto the outer and inner layers of bulk boron nitride. There are three types of BN functionalization: covalent, ionic and or non-covalent. Layers are exfoliated by placing the functionalized BN into a solvent and allowing the solvation force between the attached groups and the solvent to break the van der Waal forces between BN layers. This method is slightly different from solvent exfoliation, which relies on the similarities between the surface energies of the solvent and boron nitride layers.\n\nSolid state reactions \nHeating a mixture of boron and nitrogen precursors, such as boric acid and urea, can produce boron nitride nanosheets.  The number of layers in these nanosheets was controlled by temperature (ca. 900 ˚C) and the urea content.\n\nProperties and applications \nMechanical properties. Monolayer boron nitride has an average Young's modulus of 0.865 TPa and fracture strength of 70.5 GPa. In contrast to graphene, whose strength decreases dramatically with increased thickness, few-layer boron nitride sheets have a strength similar to that of monolayer boron nitride.\n\nThermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of atomically thin boron nitride is one of the highest among semiconductors and electrical insulators; it increases with reduced thickness due to less intra-layer coupling.\n\nThermal stability. The air stability of graphene shows a clear thickness dependence: monolayer graphene is reactive to oxygen at 250 °C, strongly doped at 300 °C, and etched at 450 °C; in contrast, bulk graphite is not oxidized until 800 °C. Atomically thin boron nitride has much better oxidation resistance than graphene. Monolayer boron nitride is not oxidized till 700 °C and can sustain up to 850 °C in air; bilayer and trilayer boron nitride nanosheets have slightly higher oxidation starting temperatures. The excellent thermal stability, high impermeability to gas and liquid, and electrical insulation make atomically thin boron nitride potential coating materials for preventing surface oxidation and corrosion of metals and other two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as black phosphorus.\n\nBetter surface adsorption. Atomically thin boron nitride has been found to have better surface adsorption capabilities than bulk hexagonal boron nitride.",

Prithviraj Kapoor founded 'Prithvi Theatres', a travelling theatre company in 1944. The company ran for sixteen years. Ved Segan was the architect who designed and built the Theatre with the supervision of Jennifer Kapoor. Jennifer, (Trustee) supervised the building and running of the theatre until her death in 1984.

Its maiden performance was Kalidasa's classic \"Shakuntala\". In subsequent years the theatre staged more than 2,600 plays such as \"Deewar\" (Wall), \"Pathan\" (a community comprising Hindus and Muslims of North India), \"Ghaddar\" (Traitor), \"Aahuthi\" (Offering), \"Kalaakar\" (Artist), \"Paisa\" (Money) and \"Kisaan\" (Farmer). Prithviraj starred as the lead actor in every show. His work in the Indian film industry funded the activities of the company \n\nPrithviraj Kapoor's youngest son Shashi Kapoor, who had trained as an actor and director in the Prithvi Theatres, married Jennifer Kendal, daughter of Laura and Geoffrey Kendal, and the leading actress of their theatre company, Shakespearana. Shashi and Jennifer toured with both their parent’s companies – Prithvi Theatres and Shakespeareana, and shared a deep passion for theatre, and a great respect for Prithviraj's dream for Indian theatre.\n\nRe-emergence\n\nPrithviraj Kapoor’s dream was to have a permanent place for his theatre company. In 1962 he managed to lease a plot of land in Juhu on which to create a theatre space. Unfortunately his ill-health and subsequent death in 1972 delayed his dream turning into reality.  The year he died the lease on the land expired and was offered on sale to his family. Shashi Kapoor and his wife Jennifer decided to make Prithviraj’s dream a reality by buying the land, and setting up the 'Shri Prithviraj Kapoor Memorial Trust & Research Foundation' in his memory with the intention of building a space to promote Hindi theatre and the performing arts.\n\nPrithvi Theatre was inaugurated on 5 November 1978 in Mumbai. \"Udhwastha Dharmashala\", written by G P Deshpande, staged  by Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and Benjamin Gilani was Prithvi's first play. This was followed by a play by the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), a political satire, \"Bakri\", directed by actor-director M. S. Sathyu.\n\nTheatre in Mumbai at the time was dominated by amateur English theatre of South Mumbai, Gujarati farce and low-key Marathi theatre in Dadar. Hindi theatre was at an all-time low with few venues available. Prithvi Theatre offered Hindi theatre an affordable platform where new styles and forms could be experimented with, a new exciting venue for the performers, directors, writers of theatre in the city, and creating a new audience for the genre.\n\nThe theatre's fifth anniversary in 1983 was celebrated with a festival to showcase the best of Prithvi, an event considered a success with audience and critics alike. By now the Prithvi Café, attached to the Theatre had become a well known meeting place for artists and art lovers.\n\nJennifer Kapoor, the driving strength, mentor and inspiration of Prithvi Theatre died on 7 September 1984. The theatre was not allowed to close on the day of her death, and the ‘show went on’ in true theatre tradition. Jennifer and Shashi's eldest son, Kunal Kapoor, with the help of Feroz Abbas Khan, took over the running of the theatre, and held a month-long Festival in February 1985 showcasing theatre from all over India.   Ustad Zakir Hussain, of whom Jennifer was great fan, performed on her birthday, 28 February during the festival, along with Pandit Shivkumar Sharma. Ustad Zakir Hussain has continued to perform every year on this date at Prithvi – probably the only place where audience members can experience Indian classical music without amplification – in the classic style of a ‘baithak’ – as was traditionally performed.\n\nIn the 1990s, Jennifer’s daughter Sanjna Kapoor started to help her brother Kunal Kapoor in the running of the theatre and its various activities.",

The ohio bicentennial was a series of events and programs held in the u.s. State of ohio to celebrate the 200th anniversary of its statehood on march 1, 2003. The ohio bicentennial commission was established by the ohio general assembly in 1995 to sponsor commemorative barn paintings, bells, and historical markers throughout the state in the years leading up to the celebration. Other state and federal agencies also marked the anniversary with special events and designations.\n\nOne notable commemoration was the barn painting program. From 1997 to september 2002, scott hagan of belmont county painted a barn in each of ohio's 88 counties with the committee's logo and colors. Nearly 2,000 barn owners volunteered their barns to be painted, and a total of 101 barns were painted freehand. Unfortunately, by 2013, many of the painted barns had faded or been repainted or torn down. Scott hagan went on to paint barn advertisements across the country after that.\n\nAnother unique celebration was the verdin company casting a bronze bell on site, out in the open, in each county throughout the bicentennial year. The process for casting each bell took two days using a mobile foundry.\n\nDuring the summer of 2003, there was also a wagon train that traveled across the state on the historic national road from martins ferry to the indiana state line at new paris.\n\nIn addition to these events, the ohio bureau of motor vehicles issued a radical redesign of the state's license plate, with a design that bore the commission's logo, the words \"1803 ohio bicentennial 2003,\" and a new six-digit numbering scheme.\n\nThere were other commemorations as well, including a u.s. Mint release of 632,032,000 quarters, the restoration of the adena mansion, and the designation of the blaine hill \"s\" bridge as the \"ohio bicentennial bridge.\" \n\n<user> What was the purpose of the barn painting program and its significance? \n\n<assistant> The barn painting program was conceived as a cost-effective way to advertise and celebrate ohio's 200th anniversary. Each barn cost around $1,500 to paint, which was $500 less than the rent for a billboard. By having a painted barn in each county, it encouraged residents and visitors to travel the state and experience ohio's diverse rural landscape while commemorating the state's historic milestone. Not only did it raise awareness of the bicentennial, but it also showcased ohio's proud agricultural heritage and the importance of barns in rural communities. \n\n<user> That's interesting! it seems like a creative and unique way to celebrate such an occasion. i'm curious about the bronze bells cast in each county. how were they made using a mobile foundry, and what was the significance of these bells? \n\n<assistant> The ohio bicentennial commission commissioned the verdin company of cincinnati to cast a bronze bell in each of the 88 ohio counties during the bicentennial year. The company used a mobile foundry to create the bells on-site, out in the open, providing a unique and educational experience for the public.\n\nThe mobile foundry was a portable furnace and casting system that allowed the verdin company to transport the necessary equipment to each location. The process of casting a bell took two days. First, the furnace heated the bronze to approximately 2,200 degrees fahrenheit, at which point it became molten. Then, the molten bronze was carefully poured into a mold to form the bell. Upon cooling and solidification, the bell was removed from the mold, cleaned, and polished.\n\nThe significance of these bells was manifold. They served as a symbol of unity, representing each county's participation in the state's bicentennial celebration. Additionally, the bells showcased ohio's rich history of metalworking and craftsmanship. They also created lasting landmarks in each county, honoring the state's 200 years of progress and heritage. \n\n<user> Sounds like a fantastic celebration! are there any resources or links to find more about ohio bicentennial or see the photographs of those barns? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are resources where you can find more information and photographs of the ohio bicentennial and its related events.

You can explore the images and learn more about each barn's location. Here's the link: http://www.ohiobarns.com/othersites/bicentennial/bicent.html\n\n2.

The site has links to early christian worship, marked by a standing celtic cross. The community surrounding the cathedral was established by saint dubricius, and the first church on this site was founded by his successor, saint teilo. They, along with their successor oudoceus, are considered the cathedral's patron saints.\n\nThe normans occupied glamorgan following the norman conquest, and construction of the cathedral began around 1120 under bishop urban. The work is believed to have been completed during the time of bishop nicholas ap gwrgant, who died in 1183. The cathedral is dedicated to st. Peter and st. Paul, st. Dubricius, st. Teilo, and st. Oudoceus.\n\nThroughout the centuries, llandaff cathedral has seen numerous alterations and additions, such as the lady chapel built by bishop william de braose in the late 13th century. The structure has faced many instances of severe damage, including the 1400 rebellion of owain glyndŵr, the english civil war when it was occupied by parliamentarian troops, and the great storm of 1703.\n\nIn the early 18th century, the damage was so significant that the see's removal was considered. However, a new cathedral was constructed starting in 1734 under the architect john wood, the elder. The cathedral suffered further damage during the cardiff blitz of world war ii when a parachute mine caused the roof to collapse.\n\nPost-wwii, restoration work was completed using concrete, pennant sandstone, welsh slate, and lead. A notable incident in 2007 involved a lightning strike damaging the organ, prompting a £1.5 million fundraiser for a new organ.\n\nThe cathedral has a long tradition of choirs, including a boys' and men's choir and a girls' choir, with the cathedral school, llandaff, serving as the dedicated choir school. Notable tombs in the cathedral include those of saints, kings, and bishops from various periods of its history. \n\n<user> Can you provide more information about the damage during the english civil war? \n\n<assistant> During the english civil war, llandaff cathedral experienced significant damage when it was overrun by parliamentarian troops. The conflict between the royalists, who supported king charles i, and the parliamentarians, who sought greater power for the parliament, had a profound impact on many structures and institutions, including llandaff cathedral.\n\nThe troops didn't only cause physical damage to the cathedral itself; they also targeted important religious artifacts, books, and other valuable items. They seized numerous books from the cathedral library and took them to cardiff castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the book of common prayer. In a cruel twist, the wives of some sequestered clergymen were invited to the castle to warm themselves by the fire fueled by these precious documents.\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, a man named milles, claiming to be a practicing puritan, took advantage of the situation and used parts of the cathedral for personal gain. He established a tavern within the structure, housed his animals in various parts of the cathedral, and even used the font as a trough for his pigs. The resulting damage and sacrilege compounded the difficulties faced by the cathedral during this time. \n\n<user> Restoration after world war ii? \n\n<assistant> Following the severe damage suffered by llandaff cathedral during the cardiff blitz of world war ii, extensive restoration efforts were undertaken to rebuild and preserve the historical structure. The impact of the parachute mine led to the roofs of the nave, south aisle, and chapter house being blown off, necessitating significant work to stabilize and restore the cathedral.\n\nThe post-war restoration focused on using materials such as concrete and pennant sandstone for structural repairs and reconstructions. The roofs were replaced using welsh slate and lead, preserving the appearance and architectural integrity of the building while ensuring its longevity.\n\nThe rebuilding process allowed for the opportunity to modernize certain aspects of the cathedral. However, care was taken to respect the historical value of this important religious and cultural site. The restoration work involved a delicate balance between addressing the functional needs of the cathedral and retaining its historical architectural features, ensuring llandaff cathedral remains a treasure for future generations.\n\nSince the restoration, the cathedral has continued to serve as a prominent place of worship and a source of inspiration for its community, visitors, and choirs who perform there, preserving not only its physical structure but also its spiritual significance in the years since the war. \n\n<user> What is special about the cathedral school, llandaff? \n\n<assistant> The cathedral school, llandaff is a unique institution within the church in wales because it is the only dedicated choir school in the organization. The school plays a vital role in supporting llandaff cathedral's long-established anglican choir tradition, which includes both boys and men's choirs and, more recently, a girls' choir. Participating in a choir at the school allows students to develop their musical abilities while engaging in spiritual and cultural experiences within the context of the historic llandaff cathedral.\n\nLocated in a picturesque part of cardiff, the cathedral school is an independent, co-educational day and boarding school catering to students from the ages of 3 to 18. The school prides itself on offering a well-rounded education that integrates academic, cultural, and spiritual aspects. They emphasize not only the development of each student's intellectual abilities but also their individual talents, character, and creativity.\n\nAs a traditional choir school, music plays an essential role in the institution, and students have numerous opportunities to excel in both vocal and instrumental disciplines. The choirs of the cathedral school often perform at services, concerts, and other events locally and internationally, providing valuable performance and personal development experiences for participating students. Such opportunities allow young musicians to develop their skills and contribute to the long-standing tradition of the llandaff cathedral's choir. ",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Gameplay of pantheon: rise of the fallen and the character classes available in the game. \n\n<assistant> Pantheon: rise of the fallen emphasizes social gameplay, encouraging players to group up, join guilds, and engage in challenging encounters. The game focuses on player vs. Environment (pve) but will offer at least one pvp server at launch. When creating a character, players can choose from nine races and twelve classes categorized into four class archetypes: tank, damage, healer, and support (crowd control). Each archetype has a specific role in group settings. Solo play is possible, however, some classes might be better suited for solo encounters than others.\n\nThe game world is seamless and open, with no mini-map, encouraging exploration. The perception system guides players as they explore, while the climbing system lets them traverse vertical terrain based on their skill level.\n\nPantheon features six extreme natural climates with varying tiers of difficulty. Players may collect glyphs or spend time in a climate to acclimate and reduce detrimental effects. Character progression is gradual, with powerful spells and abilities obtainable from hard-to-find npcs. Players can upgrade abilities through the living codex system.\n\nCombat involves a limited action set and a dual-targeting system. Dispositions and traits affect npc behavior and stats, requiring players to adapt strategies when facing encounters in different areas. \n\n<user> How do the class archetypes work and can you give me examples of some of the classes for each archetype? \n\n<assistant> Sure! Class archetypes provide specific roles in group settings to facilitate balanced gameplay. There are four archetypes in pantheon: rise of the fallen:\n\n1. Tank: these classes focus on taking damage and drawing enemy attention, protecting their allies. Examples of tank classes include warrior, dire lord, and paladin.\n\n2. Damage: these classes concentrate on dealing damage to enemies quickly and efficiently. Examples of damage classes include rogue, ranger, wizard, and summoner.\n\n3. Healer: these classes focus on supporting their group members by healing, removing debuffs or negative effects, and boosting ally abilities. Examples of healer classes are cleric, druid, and shaman.\n\n4. Support (crowd control): these classes specialize in managing enemy groups and provide valuable utility to their allies. Examples of support classes are enchanter, bard, and possibly some hybrid classes.\n\nEach class offers unique abilities designed to excel in their respective roles, encouraging players to coordinate and strategize with others when faced with challenging encounters. \n\n<user> How does the dual-targeting system in combat work? \n\n<assistant> In pantheon: rise of the fallen, the dual-targeting system allows players to have both an offensive and defensive target simultaneously during combat. When a player activates an ability, the system automatically applies it to the appropriate target.\n\nFor example, let's say you're playing a healer class, and you have an enemy selected as your offensive target and an ally as your defensive target. If you use a healing ability, it will be applied to your defensive target (your ally), without needing to manually switch between targets. Conversely, if you use a damage-dealing ability, it would be directed at your offensive target (the enemy).\n\nThis system makes it easier for players to manage their abilities effectively, particularly when playing support or healer roles, as it reduces the need to switch targets constantly. The system also extends to abilities that have multiple offensive or defensive targets, enabling players to apply those abilities to their respective targets in the same manner. This design ensures a smoother combat experience and allows players to focus on tactics and teamwork rather than target management. \n\n<user> Can you explain more about dispositions and traits in combat? how do they affect the gameplay and challenge of the encounters? \n\n<assistant> Sure! Dispositions and traits are unique features in pantheon: rise of the fallen that spice up combat by altering the behavior, stats, and properties of npcs, making each encounter feel fresh and exciting.\n\nDispositions are behavioral variations that change how npcs act during combat. For instance, some dispositions might make an npc more aggressive, while others cause the npc to flee under specific conditions or target specific players. This variety ensures that players don't face repetitive, predictable encounters and need to adapt their tactics based on the dispositions they encounter.\n\nTraits, on the other hand, affect the stats and properties of npcs. These can include changes to resistances, damage types, or movement speed, among other possibilities. The combination of various traits can create unexpected challenges for players and may require a different approach to overcome compared to a standard npc.\n\nBy frequently encountering different dispositions and traits, players must continuously reevaluate their strategies during gameplay. This constant change can offer a more engaging and dynamic combat experience, preventing encounters from becoming monotonous and letting players refine their knowledge of their class abilities and tactics.

        "reference": "Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen is a high fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game currently in development from Visionary Realms, Inc. that incorporates both new and classical game mechanics. Brad McQuaid, the Co-Creator of EverQuest and founder of Visionary Realms, served as the Chief Creative Officer for Pantheon until his death in November 2019. As of February 2022, Pantheon is currently in Pre-Alpha testing.\n\nSetting\nPantheon: Rise of the Fallen takes place on the high fantasy world of Terminus, a wildly diverse planet formed from fragments of many different realms that were forced together by massive planar collisions, each bringing their own unique civilizations and deities.\n\nGameplay\nPantheon: Rise of the Fallen places a heavy emphasis on the social aspects of MMORPGs, such as grouping up with other players to overcome challenging encounters, joining guilds, and earning a reputation in the community.  Pantheon primarily has a PvE-centric design, although the developers have committed to having at least one PvP server at launch. When creating a character, players choose from nine races and twelve classes, which are divided into four class archetypes: Tank, Damage, Healer, and Support (Crowd Control). Each archetype is designed to excel at a specific role in a group setting. While PvE encounters in the game are designed to provide a challenge for a group of players, there are encounters that can be completed by a solo player. Some of the character classes are better suited for this than others, and some encounters may be more difficult and require more creative tactics when soloing, as opposed to grouping.  There are also some raid encounters, each of which is designed for either 12, 24, or 40 players.\n\nThe game world in Pantheon is a seamless open world. Pantheon does not have a mini-map, and instead aims to reward players for exploring organically. While traveling throughout the world, players may encounter the Perception system, which is designed to teach players more about their surroundings and encourage further exploration. There is also a Climbing system, which allows players to traverse almost any vertical terrain in the game if their Climbing skill level is high enough.\n\nThroughout the game world, players may encounter six extreme natural climates: Frigid, Scorching, Toxic, Anaerobic, Pressure, and Wind Shear. Furthermore, each climate has various tiers, which correspond to how punishing it is to the player. For example, a player may be able to survive being in a Tier 1 Frigid climate, but would experience some minor detrimental effects, such as a movement speed penalty. The higher tier a climate is, the more severe the detrimental effects would be. Players can collect glyphs or spend time in a climate to acclimate to it and reduce the detrimental effects.\n\nCharacter progression in Pantheon is designed to be gradual enough to make accomplishments feel more meaningful. One important aspect of character development is obtaining spells and abilities. Many of the more powerful and exotic spells and abilities are acquired from hard-to-find NPCs in various parts of the world. Players can upgrade their abilities through a system called The Living Codex. \n\nPantheon uses a limited action set system, meaning that at any given time, a player can have no more than 8 abilities that generate aggro on their action bar and 6 abilities that do not generate aggro on their utility bar. Pantheon also uses a dual-targeting system, allowing players to simultaneously have an offensive and defensive target, with abilities automatically being applied to the appropriate target when activated. Furthermore, certain abilities allow players to have multiple offensive targets or multiple defensive targets. In combat, players may encounter NPCs with Dispositions or Traits. Dispositions change the way the NPC behaves, while Traits change the stats and properties of NPCs. Both systems are designed to present players with a new encounter each time they visit a particular area, and require the players to adapt their strategies accordingly.\n\nDevelopment\nOn January 13, 2014, Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen was announced alongside a Kickstarter campaign. The funding goal was set at $800,000, but the campaign raised only $460,657 from 3,157 backers. Because the funding goal was not reached, Visionary Realms did not receive any of the pledged money.",

The marsannay appellation d'origine contrôlée (aoc) primarily utilizes pinot noir for red and rosé wines, and chardonnay for white wines. Red wines make up two-thirds of the production.\n\nThroughout history, marsannay's vineyard has faced various challenges and growth opportunities. Roman emperor domitian's edict in 92 ad partly uprooted the vines, but christianity's rise led to vineyard expansion. In the 19th century, the vineyards struggled with pests and diseases, while the 20th century saw the introduction of modern technology to improve wine production practices.\n\nThe region enjoys a temperate climate with a slight continental tendency, which influences the wine's characteristics. The careful management of grape varieties, particularly pinot noir and chardonnay, ensures that the wines exhibit desirable traits such as richness, color, and complexity. \n\n<user> That's interesting! can you share more details on how specific historical events and technological advances helped shape marsannay's wine production and the significance of pinot noir and chardonnay for the region? also, how is marsannay's aoc different compared to other appellations? \n\n<assistant> Sure! In 1395, philip the bold favored pinot noir over gamay, improving wine quality. The côte d'or vineyard's first description was written in 312 ad by a disciple of eumène. Vineyard expansion occurred in the early 6th century due to christianity and the rise of abbeys. Charles vi's decree in 1416 limited burgundy wine production by fixing limits.\n\nThe 19th century experienced snout moth attacks, powdery mildew, and the emergence of phylloxera. The 20th century marked the use of high clearance tractors, stainless steel tanks, and electric presses. Aoc marsannay was created in 1987, making it the côte de nuits' most recent addition.\n\nMarsannay's aoc allows for rosé wines under the designation marsannay rosé, which is unique among village-level appellations; other burgundy rosés fall under the regional appellation bourgogne. Marsannay doesn't have grand cru or premier cru vineyards. \n\n<user> Great! could you tell me more about the grape varieties and vineyard presentation in marsannay's communes, particularly the composition of red and rosé wines and white wines, and what makes these varieties so special? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Marsannay's vineyard covers the communes marsannay-la-côte, chenôve, and couchey. The vineyard comprises red and rosé wines, as well as white wines. The predominant grape variety for red and rosé wines is pinot noir, and for white wines, it's chardonnay.\n\nPinot noir is a delicate variety, which contributes to the region's distinctive red wines. The grapes are dark blue and ovoid, forming small, dense clusters in a pine-shaped arrangement. Pinot noir is prone to various diseases like mildew, parasitic rougeot, gray mold, and plant hopper. This grape variety requires proper management, including removing unwanted buds and monitoring its early ripening. It has a high potential for sugar accumulation, with moderate acidity at maturity. The resulting wines are rich, powerful, colorful, and moderately tannic, showcasing marsannay's terroir.\n\nChardonnay, used for marsannay's white wines, is appreciated for its adaptability, producing wines with diverse characteristics depending on the growing conditions, terroir, and winemaking techniques. Chardonnay's versatility contributes to the unique qualities of marsannay's white wines. The grape produces wines with fruity and floral aromas that develop more complexity with age, featuring notes of butter, toast, and nuts.\n\nThe vineyard presentation in marsannay highlights the region's commitment to quality and distinct characteristics. The focus on pinot noir and chardonnay for their respective wine styles allows for a refined expression of the region's terroir, showing how these grape varieties can adapt and thrive in the specific growing conditions and climate of marsannay.\n\nThe attention to detail in managing the growth and cultivation of these grape varieties in the context of marsannay's vineyard presentation ensures that the wines produced maintain their unique character and quality, reflecting the regional essence and expertise in viticulture and winemaking practices. \n\n<user> Thanks for the information. last question: how is marsannay wine typically consumed or paired with food? \n\n<assistant> Marsannay's pinot noir-based red wines pair well with a variety of dishes, particularly game meats, grilled or roasted red meats, and flavorful poultry like duck. These wines also complement earthy flavors such as mushrooms or truffles, and soft or medium-textured cheeses. Their rich and robust character allows for versatile food pairings.\n\nMarsannay's chardonnay-based white wines work well with seafood dishes, mildly spiced dishes, white meats like chicken, and vegetable-based courses. They also pair nicely with creamy pasta dishes and soft cheeses. Their fruit and floral notes, along with their acidity, help balance and complement the flavors in these types of dishes.\n\nMarsannay rosé wines can be enjoyed as an aperitif, with light salads, grilled fish, shellfish, or dishes featuring bright flavors and herbs. Their unique character is both refreshing and food-friendly, allowing them to be versatile in pairings.\n\nEach of these marsannay wines showcases the region's terroir and adds depth and enjoyment to various meals by complementing and enhancing flavors.

        "reference": "Marsannay wine is produced in the communes of Marsannay-la-Côte, Couchey and Chenôve in the Côte de Nuits subregion of Burgundy. The Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) Marsannay may be used for red and rosé wine with Pinot noir, as well as white wine with Chardonnay as the main grape variety. Red wine accounts for the largest part of the production, around two-thirds. Marsannay is the only village-level appellation which may produce rosé wines, under the designation Marsannay rosé. All other Burgundy rosés are restricted to the regional appellation Bourgogne. There are no Grand Cru or Premier Cru vineyards in Marsannay. The Marsannay AOC was created in 1987, and is the most recent addition to the Côte de Nuits.\n\nHistory\n\nAncient times \nThe edict issued by the Roman emperor Domitian in 92AD prevented the planting of new vines outside Italy. He had the vines in Burgundy partly uprooted to avoid competition. The remaining vineyards were enough to meet the locals' needs. But Probus revoked the edict in 280.  In 312, a disciple of Eumène wrote the first description of the Côte d'Or vineyard.\n\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance \n\nFrom the early 6th century, the introduction of Christianity had encouraged vineyard expansion with large areas attached to the abbeys dedicated to this.  \nThus the Cîteaux Abbey (founded in 1098) with plantations in Côte d'Or.\nIn the year 1395, Philip the Bold decided to improve the quality of wines and prohibited the cultivation of the Gamay grape on his land in favor of Pinot noir. Finally in 1416, Charles VI issued a decree which fixed a limit on the production of Burgundy wine. In 1422, according to the records, the harvest took place in August in Côte de Nuits. Upon the death of Charles the Bold, the Burgundy vineyard was annexed back to France during the reign of Louis XI.\n\nModern period\n\nAlso in 1700, the intendant Ferrand wrote a \"memo instructing the Duke of Burgundy\", indicating to him that the best wines in this province came from the \"vineyards [which] border on Côte de Nuits and Côte de Beaune\".\n\nContemporary period\n\n19th century \nIn the 1830s and 1840s, the snout moth came and attacked the vine leaves. It was followed by a fungal disease called powdery mildew (Oidium). The vintage year 1865 produced wines with very high natural levels of sugar and very early harvests. At the end of the century two new vine scourges emerged. The first was mildew, another fungal disease, and the second was phylloxera.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Haunting ground and its gameplay elements. \n\n<assistant> Haunting ground is a survival horror video game developed and published by capcom for the playstation 2 in 2005. The game is set in a castle where players control fiona belli, a young girl who wakes up in the dungeon after being involved in a car accident. Throughout the story, with the assistance of a white shepherd named hewie, fiona seeks to escape the castle and unravel its mysteries.\n\nThe gameplay of haunting ground shares many similarities with capcom's earlier survival horror title clock tower 3, and has been considered a spiritual successor to the clock tower series. Players control fiona belli directly and give commands to her canine companion, hewie. Fiona can run, perform a backstep maneuver, and crouch to hide from enemy pursuers. She can also kick and tackle enemies, though tackling reduces stamina. Losing too much stamina will result in fiona's exhaustion, slowing down her movements or making her stop. Exhaustion can be recovered with items or time.\n\nEnvironmental interactions include opening doors, climbing ladders, and checking items. There are hiding spots and retaliation points, which fiona can use to evade pursuers or counterattack enemies, respectively. Hewie, the canine companion, plays an integral role in the gameplay. He won't completely obey fiona at first, and the player will have to build a trusting relationship with him to survive. Hewie can be commanded to sniff out items, attack enemies, or explore the environment. Players can praise or scold hewie to affect his behavior.\n\nEnemies can hear footsteps and other sounds, making stealth crucial for survival. Fiona may fall into panic mode when in danger, during which visibility becomes worse, and her movements become erratic. Damage can be recovered with items or time, but receiving too much damage will result in fiona's death. \n\n<user> How was haunting ground received and what did the critics think? \n\n<assistant> Haunting ground received mixed to average reviews when it was first released in april 2005. Critics praised the graphics and presentation of the game. Additionally, the sexual overtones that presented a disturbing and off-putting atmosphere were also appreciated for adding a unique feel to the game. Hewie, the canine companion, was credited for contributing to this unique feel, as the dog mechanic allowed players to rely on a partner for help and problem-solving.\n\nHowever, despite the graphical and atmospheric elements being well-received, the game's story was criticized for being cliché. Some gameplay aspects were noted as predictable and dated, which had an impact on the overall experience for players.\n\nDespite these criticisms, haunting ground went on to become a cult classic in the survival horror genre, with many players fondly reminiscing about its unique mechanics and atmosphere. The game was re-released digitally in japan for the playstation 3 in 2015, showcasing its enduring appeal and interest.\n\nIt is important to note that while haunting ground didn't necessarily revolutionize the survival horror genre, it still managed to distinguish itself from similar games with its unique gameplay elements involving the partnership with a canine companion and a strong emphasis on hiding, evasion, and using the environment to outsmart enemies. These features have contributed to the game's cult status and the continued appreciation of haunting ground among fans of survival horror. \n\n<user> How did the dog mechanic idea come about during the development of the game? \n\n<assistant> The inclusion of the dog mechanic in haunting ground was a conscious decision made by the developers at capcom during the game's development. The idea behind this move was their belief that retailers and players may not be as receptive to a survival horror title featuring only a lone female protagonist. By adding hewie, the white shepherd companion, the development team hoped to make the game more appealing and engaging to players.\n\nThe dog mechanic turned out to create a unique dynamic in the gameplay, as hewie's role became central to the player's survival. Players have the opportunity to build a trusting relationship with hewie, which further enhances the game experience. His presence aids in exploring the environment, attacking enemies, and solving puzzles, offering vital support to fiona, the protagonist.\n\nAdditionally, the interplay between fiona and hewie adds emotional depth to the game, as their growing bond and reliance on one another contributes to a richer, more immersive story. The introduction of hewie as an ai companion also introduced innovative gameplay dynamics, challenging players to adapt their playstyle to incorporate and communicate effectively with their canine friend for survival.\n\nIn summary, the dog mechanic was introduced as a way to make the game more appealing and differentiate it from other survival horror games. This decision proved to be successful in giving the game a distinctive identity and added both emotional and strategic depth to the players' experiences. ",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I've been looking into decision making processes, and i came across something called the priority heuristic. can you please explain what it is, how it works, and how it predicts classic violations of expected utility theory, such as the allais paradox or the certainty effect? i would really appreciate a brief overview and some examples of its application. \n\n<assistant> The priority heuristic is a simple, lexicographic decision-making strategy that correctly predicts classic violations of expected utility theory, like the allais paradox, four-fold pattern, certainty effect, possibility effect, and intransitivities. It builds on rubinstein's three-step model and is designed to help people make choices between gambles in a systematic and efficient manner.\n\nThe priority heuristic consists of three steps: priority rule, stopping rule, and decision rule. In the priority rule, reasons for choosing between gambles are examined in this order: minimum gain, chance of minimum gain, and maximum gain. The stopping rule determines when to stop comparing factors - either when minimum gains differ by 1/10 (or more) of the maximum gain or when chances differ by 10% (or more). Finally, the decision rule chooses the gamble with the more attractive gain (chance).\n\nThis heuristic can predict the majority choice in many classic decision-making problems like the allais paradox or the certainty effect by using this simple, structured approach to evaluate and compare gambles. Let me provide examples in the next response. \n\n<user> Thanks for the explanation! can you please give detailed examples of how the priority heuristic is applied to decision-making problems like the allais paradox, and other choice problems like the one you mentioned, which were developed to support prospect theory? i'd appreciate it if you could describe the problems and how the priority heuristic can predict majority choices. \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Let's look at two choice problems designed to support prospect theory and see how the priority heuristic predicts the majority choices.\n\nProblem 1:\nGamble a: 80% chance to win 4,000; 20% chance to win nothing.\nGamble b: 100% chance to win 3,000.\n\nMost people choose b (80%). The priority heuristic compares the minimum gains (0 for a and 3,000 for b). The difference is 3,000, which exceeds 400 (10% of the maximum gain). Examination stops, and people are predicted to prefer the sure gain b, aligning with the majority choice.\n\nProblem 2:\nGamble c: 45% chance to win 6,000; 55% chance to win nothing.\nGamble d: 90% chance to win 3,000; 10% chance to win nothing.\n\nMost people choose d (86%). The priority heuristic compares minimum gains (0 and 0), leading to a comparison of probabilities (0.45 and 0.90). This difference exceeds 10%, so examination stops, and people are predicted to choose d due to its higher probability of winning.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the predictive power of the priority heuristic in decision-making problems and its ability to capture behavioral patterns observed in classic experiments. \n\n<user> I'm still a bit confused about these steps and rules of the priority heuristic. can you please explain them to me in simpler terms or like you would to a child? would it be possible to provide a basic example to help me understand the concept better? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Let me explain the priority heuristic in simpler terms.\n\nImagine you're choosing between two mystery boxes, and each box gives you a prize. The prizes can be toys, and the priority heuristic helps you decide which box to pick. The steps are:\n\n1. Priority rule: you check three things in order: the least cool toy (minimum gain), the chance of getting the least cool toy (chance of minimum gain), and the coolest toy (maximum gain).\n\n2. Stopping rule: you stop checking when you find a big enough difference between boxes. For example, if one box has way cooler toys (1/10 or more of the coolest toy), or if one box has a much higher chance (10% or more) of giving you the least cool toy.\n\n3. Decision rule: you pick the box with the cooler toys (higher gain) or the box with a smaller chance of giving you the least cool toy.\n\nNow, let's say you have two mystery boxes:\n\nBox a: 8/10 chance of getting a cool robot; 2/10 chance of getting an empty box.\nBox b: 10/10 chance of getting a neat action figure.\n\nWith the priority heuristic, you check the least cool prize, (empty box for a and action figure for b). The difference (empty vs. Action figure) is big enough, so you stop and choose box b because it has a cooler guaranteed prize.\n\nThis simple example demonstrates the steps of the priority heuristic while making it easier to understand for a younger audience. \n\n<user> Is the priority heuristic always accurate in predicting people's choices? What are some of its limitations and criticisms? \n\n<assistant> While the priority heuristic correctly predicted the majority choice in all one-stage gambles in kahneman and tversky's 1979 study and outperformed other decision-making models, it does have limitations and has faced criticisms.\n\nFirst, the priority heuristic may fail to predict simple decisions that are typically not tested in experiments. Since real-life decisions often contain nuance and complexity, the heuristic may fall short when applied to broader contexts.\n\nSecond, the priority heuristic has no free parameters. This means it cannot account for variations in decision-making between individuals, as it assumes uniformity in the cognitive process among people.\n\nThis lack of flexibility can undermine the predictive accuracy of the model for specific individuals or subpopulations, leading to deviations from the majority choice.\n\nCritics argue that such simplifications can misrepresent the true complexity of human decision-making processes. However, supporters of the priority heuristic counter that it's crucial to understand its strengths, as it offers a simple and effective way of capturing a substantial portion of human choices in laboratory settings.\n\nIn summary, the priority heuristic shows promise in predicting certain decision-making patterns, but it's essential to recognize its limitations when considering its applicability across diverse contexts and individual differences.

        "reference": "The priority heuristic is a simple, lexicographic decision strategy that correctly predicts classic violations of expected utility theory such as the Allais paradox, the four-fold pattern, the certainty effect, the possibility effect, or intransitivities. \n\nThe heuristic maps onto Rubinstein’s three-step model, according to which people first check dominance and stop if it is present, otherwise they check for dissimilarity. To highlight Rubinstein’s model consider the following choice problem:\n\nI: 50% chance to win 2,000\n50% chance to win nothing\n\nII: 52% chance to win 1,000\n48% chance to win nothing\n\nDominance is absent, and while chances are similar monetary outcomes are not. Rubinstein’s model predicts that people check for dissimilarity and consequently choose Gamble I. Unfortunately, dissimilarity checks are often not decisive, and Rubinstein suggested that people proceed to a third step that he left unspecified. The priority heuristic elaborates on Rubinstein’s framework by specifying this Step 3.\n\nPriority heuristic \nFor illustrative purposes consider a choice between two simple gambles of the type “a chance c of winning monetary amount x; a chance (100 - c) of winning amount y.” A choice between two such gambles contain four reasons for choosing: the maximum gain, the minimum gain, and their respective chances; because chances are complementary, three reasons remain: the minimum gain, the chance of the minimum gain, and the maximum gain.\n\nFor choices between gambles in which all outcomes are positive or 0, the priority heuristic consists of the following three steps (for all other choices see Brandstätter et al. 2006):\n\nPriority rule: Go through reasons in the order of minimum gain, the chance of minimum gain, and maximum gain.\n\nStopping rule: Stop examination if the minimum gains differ by 1/10 (or more) of the maximum gain; otherwise, stop examination if chances differ by 10% (or more).\n\nDecision rule: Choose the gamble with the more attractive gain (chance). The term “attractive” refers to the gamble with the higher (minimum or maximum) gain and to the lower chance of the minimum gain.\n\nExamples \nConsider the following two choice problems, which were developed to support prospect theory, not the priority heuristic.\n\nProblem 1\nA: 80% chance to win 4,000\n20% chance to win nothing\nB: 100% chance to win 3,000\n\nMost people chose B (80%). The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains of the Gambles A (0) and B (3,000). The difference is 3,000, which is larger than 400 (10% of the maximum gain), the examination is stopped; and the heuristic predicts that people prefer the sure gain B, which is in fact the majority choice.A\n\nProblem 2\nC: 45% chance to win 6,000\n55% chance to win nothing\nD: 90% chance to win 3,000 \n10% chance to win nothing\n\nMost people (86%) chose Gamble D. The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains (0 and 0). Because they do not differ, the probabilities (.45 and .90 or their logical complements .55 and .10) are compared. This difference is larger than 10%, examination stops and people are correctly predicted to choose D because of its higher probability of winning.\n\nEmpirical support and limitations \nThe priority heuristic correctly predicted the majority choice in all (one-stage) gambles in Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Across four different data sets with a total of 260 problems, the heuristic predicted the majority choice better than (a) cumulative prospect theory, (b) two other modifications of expected utility theory, and (c) ten well-known heuristics (such as minimax or equal-weight) did. However, the priority heuristic fails to predict many simple decisions (that are typically not tested in experiments) and has no free parameters (which means that it cannot explain the heterogeneity of decisions between subjects), which triggered criticism,\nand countercriticism.\n\nSee also\n Mathematics\n Economics\n Combinatorics\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/eb/EB_Priority_2006.pdf\n\nHeuristics",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Significance of public health genomics and how it can benefit society? \n\n<assistant> Public health genomics is a relatively new field that focuses on the use of genomics information to improve public health. It aims to provide more effective preventive care and disease treatments that are specifically tailored to the genetic makeup of each patient. By assessing the impact of genes and their interaction with behavior, diet, and the environment on the population's health, public health genomics can help create better health programs and policies.\n\nGovernments and institutions have launched public health genomics projects to advance genomic sciences for improving health, preventing diseases, and educating the public health workforce, healthcare providers, and citizens. Public policy initiatives, such as the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008, have been put in place to protect against genetic discrimination, ensuring equal treatment for all.\n\nOne of the main concerns regarding genomic information is ensuring confidentiality, preventing misuse of information by health plans, employers, and medical practitioners, and guaranteeing equitable access to genetic information. Ethical considerations also play a significant role in public health genomics, necessitating public involvement to maintain trust and ensure equitable access to genomic research benefits.\n\nUnderstanding genetic susceptibility to diseases, for instance, single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), helps identify individuals at risk and develop personalized preventive measures. Current genetic tests check for diseases like cystic fibrosis, tay-sachs disease, and some rare cancers, among others.\n\nIn summary, public health genomics has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and disease prevention by offering more personalized, effective care and fostering public health policies that emphasize genetic information's responsible use. \n\n<user> How can public health genomics help with certain diseases like herpesvirus and bacterial infections? can you provide an example? \n\n<assistant> Public health genomics can improve our understanding of the complex interaction between genetic factors and infections, such as herpesvirus and bacterial infections, ultimately leading to better prevention and treatment strategies.\n\nAn example of how genomics can shed light on these interactions can be seen in a study published in nature. The study found that mice with a latent infection of a herpesvirus, specifically murine gammaherpesvirus 68, showed increased resistance to the listeria monocytogenes bacterium when compared to mice without the latent infection. This discovery implies that certain latent viral infections may influence host susceptibility to other bacterial infections.\n\nThe field of genomics allows scientists to study the entire genome of an organism, including the effects of latent viral infections on the host's health. Since herpesvirus dna integrates into the host's chromosome and propagates through cell replication, it can play a role in susceptibility or resistance to other infections, even though it is not part of the host's original genome.\n\nUnderstanding these intricate relationships between genetic makeup, latent viral infections, and bacterial infections can help public health genomics inform better prevention and treatment strategies, taking into account individual variation in susceptibility to diseases and responses to treatments. \n\n<user> What are the ethical concerns in public health genomics? \n\n<assistant> Ethical concerns in public health genomics arise due to the sensitive nature of genetic information and its potential impact on individuals and society. Some key ethical concerns in this field include:\n\n1. Confidentiality: maintaining the privacy of genomic information is crucial as its disclosure or misuse can lead to discrimination and stigmatization. Ensuring secure data storage and limiting access to authorized personnel are essential steps to address this concern.\n\n2. Misuse of information: there is a risk of genetic information being misused by health plans, employers, and medical practitioners, leading to discrimination or other negative consequences.

One such variation is single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), which can alter gene expression and, in some cases, lead to disease or vulnerability to disease.\n\nThe information gleaned from detecting genetic susceptibility to diseases can be used for better prevention and treatment in several ways:\n\n1. Personalized prevention: individuals identified as being at high risk for certain diseases can receive tailored preventive measures, such as lifestyle modifications, early screenings, and targeted interventions to reduce disease risk.\n\n2. Early diagnosis: genetic testing can help identify individuals who are more susceptible to certain diseases, enabling earlier diagnosis and intervention, which may improve the prognosis and overall outcome.\n\n3. Precision medicine: understanding the genetic factors that contribute to diseases allows for the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment plans based on an individual's unique genetic makeup, making treatments more effective and minimizing side effects.\n\n4. Genetic counseling: those with a known genetic susceptibility to diseases can receive counseling about their risks, potential impacts on family planning, and options for mitigating those risks.\n\n5. Public health initiatives: knowledge of genetic susceptibilities can inform population-level health initiatives and policies tailored to specific communities or demographics at high risk for certain diseases.\n\nOverall, the use of public health genomics to identify genetic susceptibility to diseases can lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies, enhancing healthcare quality and improvingindividuals' overall well-being.

        "reference": "Public health genomics is the use of genomics information to benefit public health. This is visualized as more effective preventive care and disease treatments with better specificity, tailored to the genetic makeup of each patient. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.), Public Health genomics is an emerging field of study that assesses the impact of genes and their interaction with behavior, diet and the environment on the population's health.\n\nThis field of public health genomics is less than a decade old. A number of think tanks, universities, and governments (including the U.S., UK, and Australia) have started public health genomics projects. Research on the human genome is generating new knowledge that is changing public health programs and policies. Advances in genomic sciences are increasingly being used to improve health, prevent disease, educate and train the public health workforce, other healthcare providers, and citizens.\n\nPublic policy\n\nPublic policy has protected people against genetic discrimination, defined in Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (2001) as unequal treatment of persons with either known genetic abnormalities or the inherited propensity for disease; genetic discrimination may have a negative effect on employability, insurability and other socio-economic variables. Public policy in the U.S. that protect individuals and groups of people against genetic discrimination include the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,  (2000) that prohibits genetic discrimination in the workplace for federal employees, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.\n\nMain public concerns regarding genomic information are that of confidentiality, misuse of information by health plans, employers, and medical practitioners, and the right of access to genetic information. Concerns also exist about the equitable deployment of public health genomics, and attention is needed to ensure that the implementation of genomic medicine does not further entrench social‐equity concerns.\n\nEthical concerns\nOne of the many facets involved in public health genomics is that of bioethics. This has been highlighted in a study in 2005 by Cogent Research, that found when American citizens were asked what they thought the strongest drawback was in using genetic information, they listed \"misuse of information/invasion of privacy\" as the single most important problem. In 2003, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics published a report, Pharmacogenetics: Ethical Issues. Authors of the document explore four broad categories of ethical and policy issues related to pharmacogenetics: information, resource, equity and control. In the introduction to the report, the authors clearly state that the development and application of pharmacogenetics depend on scientific research, but that policy and administration must provide incentives and restraints to ensure the most productive and just use of this technology. Involving the public in ethical oversight and other ways can improve public trust in public health genomics as well as acceptability of initiatives and ensuring that access to the benefits of genomics research is equitable.\n\nGenetic susceptibility to disease\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single bases within a gene sequence that differ from that gene's consensus sequence, and are present in a subset of the population. SNPs may have no effect on gene expression, or they can change the function of a gene completely. Resulting gene expression changes can, in some cases, result in disease, or in susceptibility to disease (e.g., viral or bacterial infection).\n\nSome current tests for genetic diseases include: cystic fibrosis, Tay–Sachs disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, high cholesterol, some rare cancers and an inherited susceptibility to cancer. A select few are explored below.\n\nHerpesvirus and bacterial infections\nSince the field of genomics takes into account the entire genome of an organism, and not simply its individual genes, the stud  of latent viral infection falls into this realm. For example, the DNA of a latent herpesvirus integrates into the host's chromosome and propagates through cell replication, although it is not part of the organism's genome, and was not present at the birth of the individual.\n\nAn example of this is found in a study published in Nature, which showed that mice with a latent infection of a herpesvirus were less susceptible to bacterial infections. Murine mice were infected with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 and then challenged with the Listeria monocytogenes bacterium. Mice that had a latent infection of the virus had an increased resistance to the bacteria, but those with a non-latent strain of virus had no change in susceptibility to the bacteria. The study went on to test mice with murine cytomegalovirus, a member of the betaherpesvirinae subfamily, which provided similar results.  However, infection with human herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, did not provide increased resistance to bacterial infection.",

The verbal negation predicate is \"not.\" negation is often formed by combining the auxiliary \"do\" with the negative verb. The auxiliary \"do\" indicates whether one or multiple individuals are involved, while the main verb referring to the negated activity remains non-inflected.\n\nIn contrast, uralic languages like finnish, estonian, and hungarian have different uses of negation predicates with specific similarities. Finnish employs a standard negation (sn) that is realized by a verbal complex made up of a non-finite main verb followed by the negative auxiliary bearing person and number information. The marker for tense depends on the clausal context and only appears on the main verb in the form of a connegative or past participle.\n\nEstonian uses a particle-like, non-inflectional negative auxiliary \"ei,\" positioned pre-verbally. Estonian also forms a connegative in the present tense or active past participle. Unlike other uralic languages, the negative auxiliary in estonian doesn't need to be inflectional.\n\nHungarian employs a negation particle \"nem\" for most cases. In the jussive/imperative (j-mood), this particle changes to \"ne.\" the copular verb \"lenni\" in the 3rd person present indicative has unique negative forms, \"nincs(en)\" and \"nincsenek,\" instead of the regular \"nem van\" and \"nem vannak.\" these forms are used in existential statements and don't appear when the copular verb is not used, implying the verb's presence by their absence.\n\nOverall, the use of negative verbs in english is simpler than in uralic languages, with the latter exhibiting more complex structures and various forms depending on tense, mood, and context. \n\n<user> Can you explain how negation works in Inari Sami, Northern Sami, and Lule Sami languages? I'm interested in how they conjugate negative verbs in different moods and personal forms. \n\n<assistant> Sure! Inari sami, northern sami, and lule sami languages all involve the conjugation of negative verbs in moods and personal forms. \n\nIn inari sami, the negative verb is conjugated according to mood and personal forms. The process for conjugating negative verbs involves indicative, conditional, and potential moods. For the imperative mood, particular forms and strategies are used.\n\nNorthern sami, similar to inari sami, also conjugates the negative verb in moods and personal forms. In the case of indicative, conditional, and potential moods, distinctive strategies are used for conjugation. The imperative mood also has specific forms and processes.\n\nLule sami shares the feature of conjugating negative verbs in moods and personal forms. For indicative, conditional, and potential moods, the language offers unique approaches to conjugation. As in the other languages mentioned, the imperative mood in lule sami involves distinct forms and techniques for conjugation.\n\nOverall, these three sami languages, though different in specific conjugation strategies, all conjugate negative verbs according to mood and personal forms. This makes them slightly more complex than languages like english or hungarian when dealing with negations, as they involve unique processes and structures that vary across moods and forms. \n\n<user> How we say something isn't true in finnish? what is the negative thingy that you said? \n\n<assistant> In finnish, to say something isn't true, you use a special word called a negative auxiliary. The root of this word is \"e-.\" when you want to say something negative, you first have your main verb, which is in a non-finite form. Then, you add the negative auxiliary that tells us who is doing the action and how many people. The tricky part is that the tense (like present or past) is marked on the main verb, not on the negative auxiliary. So, it may look a bit different than what you're used to in english! \n\n<user> That's fascinating! can you give me an example of a negative sentence in finnish and explain how the negation works in that sentence? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Let's take the example of a negative sentence in finnish: \"minä en syö\" which translates to \"i don't eat\" in english.\n\nIn this sentence, \"minä\" means \"i,\" \"en\" is the negative auxiliary, and \"syö\" is the non-finite form of the verb \"to eat.\" let's break down the negation:\n\n1. \"minä\" is the subject, \"i.\"\n2. \"en\" is the negative auxiliary, indicating negation, i.e., \"do not\" or \"don't\" in english. The auxiliary shows it's the first person (i or me).\n3. \"syö\" is the non-finite main verb meaning \"to eat.\" it lacks the usual personal ending because it's in a connegative form.\n\nThe sentence is structured as follows: subject (minä) + negative auxiliary (en) + non-finite main verb (syö). The negation is formed by the negative auxiliary \"en,\" which shows it's in the first person, while the main verb remains in its non-finite form (syö), without a personal ending.\n\nThis structure differs from english, where the auxiliary \"do\" is combined with the negative verb \"not\" (don't), and the main verb remains uninflected (\"eat\" stays the same).

        "reference": "Dryer  defined three different types of negative markers in language. Beside negative particles and negative affixes, negative verbs play a role in various languages. The negative verb is used to implement a clausal negation. The negative predicate counts as a semantic function and is localized and therefore grammaticalized in different languages. Negation verbs are often used as an auxiliary type which also carries φ-feature content. This could be visualized for example in the inflectional character of the negation verb while combined with the main verb. This is some sort of tendency by Dryer to place the negation verb before the finite verb. Miestamo researched four different types of negations and proposed a distinction between symmetric negation in which a negative marker is added and asymmetric negation in which beside the added negation marker, other structural changes appear.\n\nEnglish\nIn English a standard negation (SN) is used to negate declarative main clauses. The verbal negation predicate is 'not'. To negate other clauses, the negation construction differs from SN. The English auxiliary 'do' performs in combination with the negative verb that indicates whether one or multiple individuals are involved while the verb referring to the negated activity remains non-inflected. Concluding this, ordinary verbs take the auxiliary do when negated by not.\n\nUralic languages\nUralic languages differ in the use of negation predicates from each other but show specific similarities. For defining different patterns of negation predicates it is necessary to know about the lexical verb (LV) and the finite form (FE). Miestamo defined four types of asymmetry in negation verbs. The first type shows a prominent appearance in Uralic languages. It is defined as A/Fin (A = asymmetry | Fin = finiteness) and describes that influenced by the negation verb, the finiteness of the LV is reduced or lost. For example, the LV loses the finiteness because the clause is marked by the de-verbalizing negative morphem. Therefore, the copula is added as a type which holds the finite status (FE). In some uralic languages speaker produce connegatives to construct the syntactically acceptable word form used in negative clauses.\n\nFinnish \nThe standard negation (SN) in Finnish language is realized by a verbal complex. First the LV with a non-finite character is formed followed by the finite element which is presented as the negative auxiliary. The root of the auxiliary is 'e-'. The ending gives information about person and number. The marker for tense is not presented on the auxiliary and is only dependent from the clausal context. Therefore, tense is marked on the LV separated from the auxiliary and appears as connegative form in present tense and past participle in past tense.\n\nNegative Verb - Overview for clausal negations \n\nIndicative, conditional, and potential\n\nImperative\n\nEstonian\nThe Estonian language uses a particle-like non-inflectional negative auxiliary which is hierarchical presented on a pre-verbal slot. The auxiliary is realized as 'ei'. A special form differs from the SN while forming the connegative in the present tense, in the past form or the active past participle. Differing to other Uralic languages, in Estonian language the flectional character doesn't seem to be a necessary feature for the negative auxiliary. This is important because the question appears, if the auxiliary has to show a flectional marker even if the LV is not showing any flectional marker without using the negation modus.\n\nNegative Verb - Strategies in clausal negations \n\nIndicative, conditional, and oblique\n\nImperative\n\nSkolt Saami \nIn Skolt Saami the SN shows a negative auxiliary compared with a non-finite LV. For imperative a special case is provided.\n\nNegative Verb - Summary\n\nSouth Saami \nIn South Saami the SN is realized by a negative auxiliary. This form is used in present tense and the preterite. The LV is presented as a connegative form. A special case is presented while creating the imperative. In this case the negative auxiliary gets a full personal paradigm except for the third person 'dual'. The third person in singular in present tense of the negative auxiliary is prohibited as a negative reply.\n\nNegative Verb - Strategies in clausal negations\n\nInari Sami\nThe negative verb is conjugated in moods and personal forms in Inari Sami.\n\nIndicative, conditional, and potential mood\n\nImperative\n\nNorthern Sami\nThe negative verb is conjugated in moods and personal forms in Northern Sami.\n\nIndicative, conditional, and potential mood\n\nImperative\n\nLule Sami\nThe negative verb is conjugated in moods and personal forms in Lule Sami.\n\nIndicative, conditional, and potential mood\n\nHungarian \nHungarian has lost most evidence of a negative verb, but the negation particle 'nem' becomes 'ne' before verbs in the jussive/imperative (also sometimes called the conditional mood, or J-mood). Furthermore, the 3rd person present indicative of the copular verb ('lenni') has unique negative forms 'nincs(en)' and 'nincsenek' as opposed to 'nem van' and 'nem vannak', but only when the particle and verb would occur adjacently. In all other instances the copular verb acts regularly. These forms are also unique in that they have an existential role \"there is (not)\" and \"there are (not)\". In the present indicative 3rd person, copular verbs are not used; rather the absence of a verb (with or without a negation particle) implies the copula.\n\nKomi\nIn Komi language, the negative marker and the form of the negative construction is dependent of the clausal tense. If the corresponding affirmative predicate is based in a verbal form, a negative auxiliary is used. This is not convertible for affirmative verbs with nominal forms. The negative auxiliary is used in present tense, future tense, 1st past tense of indicative and in the imperative and optative mood.",

Closed those stores and focused on consolidating their business. Bannus hudson and executive vice president david richards redirected the company's growth strategy, concentrating on arizona and california. Moreover, they decided to keep store sizes more manageable, around 20,000 square feet. These strategic changes helped the company stabilize its financial position and continue expanding within the target states. By 2000, bevmo! Had become the second-largest alcoholic beverage retailer in the us, with annual sales of $130 million. \n\n<user> Sometimes people have concerns about the impact of large retail chains on local communities. were there any such concerns or disputes involving bevmo! and its expansion? if so, give me some examples and how it affected their growth. \n\n<assistant> Yes, bevmo!'s expansion faced some resistance from local communities concerned about the potential negative effects of having a large retail chain in their town. One example is the town of santa barbara, where residents opposed the establishment of a bevmo! Store. Their concerns revolved around possible outcomes such as the decline of small businesses, increased traffic patterns, and the overall impact on the community's character.\n\nThese challenges and disputes can slow down or even halt expansion plans, as companies need to address the concerns of the communities they plan to enter. Bevmo! Had to take these concerns into account when deciding on future store locations and their overall expansion strategy. It's important for retail chains like bevmo! To maintain a balance between growth and being sensitive to the concerns of local communities, ensuring that they contribute positively to the areas they serve. \n\n<user> How does bevmo! maintain compliance with age requirements for selling alcohol, especially regarding entrance to their stores? \n\n<assistant> Bevmo!

He was also a gold glove award-winning first baseman, which is awarded to the best defensive player at each position. At one point in his career, youkilis held the record for most consecutive errorless games at first base, which reflects his exceptional fielding.\n\nDespite his unconventional physique, which often led people to underestimate his athletic ability, youkilis was recognized for his achievements by being named to sporting news' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball.

His batting stance involved an unconventional setup where he would hold the bat with his hands spread apart and keep his feet comparatively close together. As the pitcher initiated the windup, youkilis would then bring his hands together and raise his leg to gain better leverage and timing. While this approach made his stance appear unorthodox and somewhat awkward, it worked effectively for him as it helped him generate power and maintain excellent plate discipline.\n\nIn addition to his peculiar batting stance, youkilis had a gritty and spirited playing style. He was known for his determination, scrappiness, and willingness to do whatever it took to help his team win. His jerseys were often covered in dirt due to his hustle on the field and his fearless nature, such as diving headfirst into bases and engaging in home-plate collisions. This intense approach to the game earned him respect from teammates, opponents, and fans alike.\n\nYoukilis' style was quite distinctive; rather than relying on pure athleticism or physical prowess, he relied on his understanding of the game, his work ethic, and his perseverance to succeed. Despite being labeled as \"roly-poly,\" \"pudgy,\" or even a \"fat kid\" by coaches and managers, he proved that hard work and dedication can lead to great success in baseball. His ability to perform at an elite level, regardless of others' opinions about his physique, is quite admirable and illustrates the importance of commitment and passion for the game. \n\n<user> How was his personal life and family background? \n\n<assistant> Kevin youkilis was born in cincinnati, ohio, to carolyn (née weekley) and mike youkilis, who worked as a wholesale jeweler. His father was born into a jewish family, while his mother converted to judaism after marrying mike. Youkilis himself identifies as jewish and had a bar mitzvah at a conservative synagogue in his youth. His father was known to play third base in the local jewish community center fast-pitch softball league, so baseball was part of his upbringing.\n\nThe youkilis family name has an interesting history as well. Kevin's jewish great-great-great-grandfather, originally from romania, moved to greece at the age of 16 to avoid conscription by the anti-semitic cossacks. Feeling homesick, he later returned to romania, changing his surname from \"weiner\" to \"youkilis\" to avoid the army and facing imprisonment.\n\nIn his younger years, youkilis had a brief uncredited one-line role in the romantic comedy film milk money when he was 14 years old. He attended sycamore high school, playing baseball in various positions such as third base, shortstop, first base, and the outfield. It is worth noting that youkilis was the only player to hit a home run off his future red sox teammate aaron cook in high school.\n\nYoukilis later attended the university of cincinnati (uc), choosing it over butler university, partly because his father and his idol, sandy koufax, were alumni of uc. During his time at the university of cincinnati, he played college baseball and worked towards achieving his dream of playing in the major leagues. ",

They are typically characterized by obvious tumors or swellings. These conditions are similar in nature, with the main difference being their location: proliferative fasciitis occurs in subcutaneous tissues, while proliferative myositis occurs in muscle tissues. \n\nIn 2020, the world health organization grouped these disorders as virtually identical and referred to them as proliferative fasciitis/proliferative myositis or proliferative fasciitis and proliferative myositis.

The lesions in PF/PM are typically obvious tumors or swellings. Historically, many studies had grouped the two descriptive forms of PF/PM as similar disorders with the exception that proliferative fasciitis occurs in subcutaneous tissues while proliferative myositis occurs in muscle tissues. In 2020, the World Health Organization agreed with this view and defined these lesions as virtually identical disorders termed proliferative fasciitis/proliferative myositis or proliferative fasciitis and proliferative myositis. The Organization also classified them as one of the various forms of the fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors.\n\nPF/PM lesions have been regarded as a tissue's self-limiting reaction to an injury or unidentified insult rather than an abnormal growth of a clone of neoplastic cells, that is, as a group of cells which share a common ancestry, have similar abnormalities in the expression and/or content of their genetic material, and often grow in a continuous and unrestrained manner. However, a recent study has found a common genetic abnormality in some of the cells in most PF/FM tumors. This suggests that PF/PM are, in at least most cases, neoplastic but nonetheless self-limiting and/or spontaneously reversing disorders. That is, they are examples of \"transient neoplasms.\" In all events, PF/PM lesions are benign tumor growths that do not metastasize.\n\nPF/PM lesions may grow at alarming rates, exhibit abnormal histopathologies (e.g. high numbers and overcrowding of cells), and have other elements that are suggestive of a malignancy. Consequently, they have been mistakenly diagnosed as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (also termed malignant fibrous histiocytoma), rhabdomyosarcoma, or other types of sarcoma and treated unnecessarily with aggressive measures used for such malignancies, e.g. wide surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The majority of PF/PM lesions are successfully treated with strictly conservative and supportive measures.\n\nPresentation\nPF/PM lesions occur primarily in middle-aged and older adults (peak age of onset 50 to 55 years/old) with no appreciable differences in their incidences between males and females.

Additionally, he was ranked the 2009 fbs tackles (tfls) for a loss (per game) champion after finishing second in 2008 by 0.1 tfl per game.\n\nGraham's performance over his college career resulted in a total of 29.5 sacks and 56 career tfls for the wolverines football team. His efforts earned him second-team 2008 big ten all-conference recognition from both the coaches and the media. \n\nIn 2009, he was a finalist for the ncaa division i fbs football hendricks award, which is given to the top defensive end in college football. He was also a first-team 2009 all-big ten selection by both coaches and media. Graham received national recognition in various first-team and second-team all-america lists from different publications.\n\nFurthermore, brandon graham was named mvp of the 2010 senior bowl, a college football all-star game that helps showcase players for the upcoming nfl draft. His college career solidified him as a top prospect heading into the nfl. \n\n<user> What were the significant accomplishments of his career with the philadelphia eagles? \n\n<assistant> Since being drafted in the first round of the 2010 nfl draft by the philadelphia eagles, brandon graham has had a productive career with the team, achieving several significant accomplishments as a defensive end.\n\nOne of the defining moments in graham's nfl career was the super bowl lii, played on february 4, 2018. The philadelphia eagles won their first super bowl title, defeating the new england patriots 41-33. Brandon graham played a crucial role in the game, where he made a game-changing play by strip-sacking new england's quarterback, tom brady, with just over two minutes left on the clock. This play helped the eagles secure their victory in the championship game.\n\nIn the 2017 season, graham had a career year when he recorded a personal best of 9.5 sacks in the regular season. He also earned pro football focus' (pff) no. 9 overall pass-rushing grade (86.0), tied for sixth in total pressures with 70, and tied for seventh in defensive stops with 37. That performance led to his selection to the 2017 pro bowl roster as an alternate.\n\nThroughout his career with the eagles, brandon graham has been well-regarded for his relentless motor, strong work ethic, and excellent skills as a pass rusher and run defender. He's also been a consistent performer and leader for the team's defense over the years.\n\nThough he experienced setbacks in his early years in the nfl due to injuries, which limited his playing time and impact, graham has since become a vital component of the eagles' defense. His achievements and contributions to the team have made him a fan favorite among philadelphia eagles supporters. \n\n<user> How did his transition from being a linebacker in high school to a defensive end in college and the nfl happen? \n\n<assistant> The transition of brandon graham from a linebacker in high school to a defensive end in college and the nfl happened due to a combination of factors, including weight gain, skill set, and coaching decisions.\n\nFollowing his high school football career, graham participated in the u.s. Army all-american bowl, violating michigan state rules about participating in out-of-state all-star games. As a consequence, he lost his high school athletic eligibility for the winter and spring seasons. During this period without athletics, he overate and added 40 pounds (18 kg) to his frame. This weight gain played a significant role in the transition from linebacker to defensive end.\n\nWhen graham joined the university of michigan's football team, the coaching staff felt that his heavier weight and skill set would be better suited for the defensive end position. In this role, he could use his size, strength, and pass-rushing ability more effectively. As brandon lost the excess weight and adapted to his new position, he realized he could excel in that role at a lighter weight.\n\nIn the nfl, the philadelphia eagles, recognizing his potential as a defensive end, drafted him in the first round. They had confidence in his ability to continue developing his skills at that position. Graham's tenacity, technique, and outstanding work ethic have since contributed to his successful transition from a high school linebacker to an nfl defensive end.\n\nThis kind of positional change is not uncommon in football, as players often experience changes in their roles based on physical development, skill sets, and team needs at the college or professional level. Brandon graham's journey illustrates his adaptability and commitment to excelling on the field, regardless of the position he plays. ",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I admire Paul Robinson for his climbing achievements. Can you tell me more about his most notable climbing feats and competition results? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Paul robinson is an accomplished professional rock climber, specializing in bouldering. He has established and repeated several v15 bouldering problems in places like hueco tanks, the buttermilks, and magic wood.\n\nIn competition, robinson has an impressive track record. In 2007, he took second place at the 8th annual american bouldering series (abs) national championships, and won the event in 2008. He also placed third at the 2008 ifsc bouldering world cup in vail, colorado. Over the years, he continued to excel, with placings such as second at the 2009 abs national championships, fourth at the 2009 ifsc bouldering world cup in vail, third in the 2013 dark horse series iv, and sixth in the 2013 ifsc bouldering world cup in vail.\n\nAmong robinson's notable climbs are the third ascent of jade (v14) in rocky mountain national park in 2007, the flash of the v13 nagual boulder, the second ascent of terremer (v15) in hueco tanks in 2008, and the first ascent of lucid dreaming (proposed v16, later v15) in the buttermilks in 2010. He spent the summer of 2010 in rocklands, south africa, where he achieved the second ascent of monkey wedding, a v15 problem, and numerous other achievements. In 2011, he took the third ascent of trip hop (v15) and claimed two v15 second ascents in europe. In 2012, he established meadowlark lemon (v14) and claimed the second ascent of paint it black (v15). \n\n<user> What's the significance of flashing a v13 boulder problem? \n\n<assistant> Flashing a boulder problem means completing it on the first attempt without having tried the problem or seen someone else climb it before. The term \"flash\" signifies that the climber has been able to understand the problem's sequence and execute it flawlessly on the first try. Flashing a v13 boulder problem is especially significant because v13 is considered to be an extremely difficult grade, reserved for elite climbers. \n\nWhen paul robinson flashed the v13 nagual boulder, it demonstrated his remarkable skill, strength, and problem-solving capabilities. Achieving a flash at such a high difficulty level is a rare accomplishment. At the time, robinson was only the second person ever to have flashed a v13 boulder problem, after james pearson. This accomplishment further solidifies his status as one of the top boulderers in the world. \n\n<user> How does the lucid dreaming problem in the buttermilks compare to other problems of a similar grade that he's climbed? \n\n<assistant> Lucid dreaming is a highball bouldering problem in the buttermilks, located near bishop, california. When paul robinson first climbed it in 2010, he proposed a grade of v16, which would have been the highest grade assigned to any bouldering problem at that time. However, he later suggested that lucid dreaming might be a v15 instead.\n\nThe boulder itself is about 50 feet from ground to top, with a steep overhang at the beginning and a slab traversal towards the end. The primary challenge of lucid dreaming lies in the two consecutive v12 moves near the start, both featuring small, technical holds. This makes it different from other v15 problems that robinson has climbed, as the crux of the difficulty is concentrated in a few powerful moves.\n\nIn comparison, other v15 problems he has climbed, like terremer in hueco tanks or monkey wedding in rocklands, may have diverse and sustained challenges throughout the problem. The uniqueness of each climb ultimately depends on factors such as holds, climbing style, and route sequence. While lucid dreaming stands out for its concentrated challenges, each v15 problem has its distinct characteristics that test the climber's capabilities in different ways. \n\n<user> How does paul robinson's accomplishments measure up against other famous climbers like chris sharma and daniel woods? \n\n<assistant> Paul robinson, chris sharma, and daniel woods are all highly accomplished climbers with impressive records. While their achievements are distinct, comparisons can be made to better understand their individual accomplishments.\n\nPaul robinson is renowned for his prowess in bouldering, having established and repeated several v15 bouldering problems. His flashes, onsights, and competition performances showcase his remarkable skill in the sport. In particular, his one-attempt flash of the v13 nagual boulder stands out as a major accomplishment.\n\nChris sharma is often considered one of the best rock climbers in the world. His achievements span both sport climbing and bouldering, with numerous first ascents of routes rated 5.15 and high-grade bouldering problems. His iconic climbs include \"jumbo love,\" the first-ever 5.15b route, and \"es pontas,\" a deep-water solo climb in mallorca. While sharma has a broader focus across different climbing disciplines, his impact and legacy in the sport are undeniable.\n\nDaniel woods is another accomplished boulderer with multiple v15 and v16 problems under his belt. His accomplishments include establishing \"the process,\" a v16 in bishop, california, and the first ascent of \"hypnotized minds\" (v16) in rocky mountain national park. In competition, he has claimed multiple abs national championships and consistently ranked highly in the ifsc world cup events.\n\nAll three of these climbers have made significant contributions to the sport of climbing, continually pushing the limits and inspiring others. Their accomplishments, while impressive in their own right, are part of a broader, growing community of climbers seeking to redefine what is possible in the sport. ",

He has established and repeated several bouldering problems at the V15 difficulty rating, in such areas as Hueco Tanks, the Buttermilks, and Magic Wood. In 2007, Robinson became the second climber in history to successfully climb a V13 boulder problem in one attempt.\n\nCompetitions \nIn 2007, Paul Robinson took second place at the 8th Annual American Bouldering Series (ABS) National Championships. The following year, Robinson took first place at the competition, beating Chris Sharma and Sean McColl. Later that year, he took third place at the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) Bouldering World Cup in Vail, Colorado. In 2009, Robinson competed once again in the ABS National Championships, this time taking second place behind Daniel Woods. At the IFSC Bouldering World Cup in Vail, he completed three of the four finals problems, placing him in fourth behind Kilian Fischhuber. In January 2013, Robinson took third place in the finals of the Dark Horse Series IV bouldering competition. The following June, Robinson reached the finals of the IFSC Bouldering World Cup in Vail, but was unable to finish any of the final boulders and took sixth place.\n\nNotable ascents \n\nIn August 2007, Robinson made the third ascent of Jade, a V14 bouldering problem in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Later that year, he climbed the V13 Nagual boulder in one attempt, an accomplishment known as a \"flash\". This made Robinson the second person to have flashed a V13, after James Pearson. The following January, Robinson claimed the second ascent of Terremer, a V15 boulder in Hueco Tanks, Texas. The problem was established by Swiss climber Fred Nicole two years earlier. At the time, it was regarded as the most challenging problem at Hueco Tanks, and Robinson described it as \"the hardest boulder I have ever done so far.\"\n\nOn 30 March 2010, Robinson claimed the first ascent of Lucid Dreaming, a highball bouldering problem in the Buttermilks near Bishop, California. He originally proposed a grade of V16, the highest bouldering grade that had yet been assigned to a problem, but he later suggested Lucid Dreaming might be a V15. The boulder is  from ground to top, beginning with a steep overhang and ending with a slab traversal. Much of the difficulty of the climb comes from two consecutive V12 moves near the beginning, both featuring small, technical holds. The problem was not repeated until January 2014.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, Robinson spent two months climbing in Rocklands, South Africa. His main project was the second ascent of Monkey Wedding, a V15 boulder problem first established in 2002 by Fred Nicole. Other achievements included a flash of The Amphitheater (V12), and two V14 first ascents: The Big Short and Black Eagle. Later that year, Robinson visited Magic Wood in Switzerland, where he established Il Trill, a boulder problem rated 8c on the Fontainebleau scale.\n\nIn February 2011, Robinson took the third ascent of Trip Hop, a V15 problem established by Sébastien Frigault in 2003. The following month, he claimed two V15 second ascents in Europe: The Story of Two Worlds, established in 2005 by Dave Graham, and Angama, established in 2006 by Dai Koyamada. In January 2012, Robinson established Meadowlark Lemon, a V14 sit-start variation of the V13 Meadowlark problem in Red Rock Canyon, Nevada. Later that year, he claimed the second ascent of Paint it Black, a V15 problem established in Rocky Mountain National Park by Daniel Woods.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n IFSC Profile\n 27 Crags Profile\n Interview with Paul Robinson\n\nSee also\n Notable first free ascents\n\nAmerican rock climbers\nLiving people\n1987 births",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Martha albertson fineman has made several important contributions to legal theory and feminist jurisprudence, including the establishment of the feminism and legal theory project and the development of the vulnerability and human condition initiative. i'm curious about the specific goals of each of these programs, as well as any major successes they have had over the years. additionally, it would be interesting to learn about some of the key publications or works produced by fineman herself, particularly those that have helped shape contemporary discussions on family law, dependency, and vulnerability. \n\n<assistant> The feminism and legal theory (flt) project was founded by martha fineman in 1984, aiming to provide a forum for interdisciplinary feminist scholarship addressing important law and society issues. Initially focused on annual summer conferences, the project expanded over time to host multiple workshops and presentations covering a broad range of topics related to feminist theory and law. The flt project has published books such as \"at the boundaries of law: feminism and legal theory\" and \"transcending the boundaries of law: generations of feminism and legal theory.\"\n\nIn 2008, fineman established the vulnerability and the human condition initiative at emory law school. The initiative seeks to engage scholars with the concepts of \"vulnerability,\" \"resilience,\" and the idea of a \"responsive state\" in constructing a universal approach to address the human condition. Through this, fineman aims to facilitate discussions on how the state should address and respond to dependent and vulnerable individuals within society.\n\nSome of fineman's influential works include her 2004 book \"the autonomy myth: a theory of dependency\" and her 2008 article \"the vulnerable subject\" in the yale journal of law and feminism, which later became the basis for her 2011 book \"the vulnerable subject.\" these works have contributed to shaping contemporary discussions around dependency, vulnerability, and justice in legal theory. \n\n<user> It's interesting to see how martha fineman's work has evolved over time, from her early focus on family law and intimacy to her current focus on vulnerability and justice. given that she directs both the feminism and legal theory project and the vulnerability and human condition initiative, how does she balance her role as a theorist and an activist in her career? moreover, how do these two projects enhance each other, especially with regard to her ideas about dependency, vulnerability, and the responsive state? \n\n<assistant> Martha fineman's career has indeed evolved, and her work in both the feminism and legal theory (flt) project and the vulnerability and the human condition initiative highlights her dedication to combining theoretical development with real-world applications.\n\nAs the founding director of the flt project, fineman brings together scholars from different disciplines to validate established expertise and encourage emerging scholars. Emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration, the flt project involves scholars in examining law and policy topics relevant to women, addressing issues of equality through the intersections of race, gender, class, sexuality, and ability.\n\nIn the vulnerability and the human condition initiative, fineman advances her theory of vulnerability, exploring the concepts of vulnerability and resilience as well as the idea of a responsive state. This initiative aims to shift the focus of policy-making towards the human condition and prompt conversations on how the state should address and respond to dependent and vulnerable individuals.\n\nBoth projects serve as platforms for intellectual exchange and real-world impact, allowing fineman to balance her roles as a theorist and an activist. While the flt project focuses on analyzing law and policy from a feminist perspective, the vulnerability initiative allows fineman to delve deeper into the broader implications of universal dependency and vulnerability.\n\nThese two programs enhance one another by establishing connections and aligning goals. The flt project explores inequality issues, providing a foundation for the vulnerability initiative’s emphasis on the notion of a responsive state addressing the everyday dependencies of individuals. Additionally, the interdisciplinary nature of the flt project encourages meaningful dialogue and collaboration, nurturing a more comprehensive understanding of vulnerability and its role in shaping law and policy.\n\nThrough these efforts, martha fineman has created a legacy of fostering interdisciplinary communication and innovative legal theories, ultimately influencing not only academic discourse but also policy-making and legal practices centered on vulnerability, dependency, and justice. \n\n<user> What are some awards or recognition that martha fineman has received throughout her career? \n\n<assistant> Martha fineman has received numerous accolades in recognition of her many achievements and contributions to legal theory, feminist jurisprudence, and family law.

        "reference": "Martha Albertson Fineman (born 1943) is an American jurist, legal theorist and political philosopher. She is Robert W. Woodruff Professor of Law at Emory University School of Law. Fineman was previously the first holder of the Dorothea S. Clarke Professor of Feminist Jurisprudence at Cornell Law School. She held the Maurice T. Moore Professorship at Columbia Law School.\n\nFineman works in the areas of feminist legal theory and critical legal theory and directs the Feminism and Legal Theory Project, which she founded in 1984. Much of her early scholarship focuses on the legal regulation of family and intimacy, and she has been called \"the preeminent feminist family theorist of our time.\" She has since broadened her scope to focus on the legal implications of universal dependency, vulnerability and justice. Her recent work formulates a theory of vulnerability. She is a progressive liberal thinker; she has been an affiliated scholar of John Podesta's Center for American Progress.\n\nCareer\n\nFineman has a B.A. from Temple University (1971) and a J.D. from the University of Chicago (1975).  After graduating from law school, she clerked for the Hon. Luther Merritt Swygert of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and was on faculty at the University of Wisconsin Law School from 1976 to 1990.  Subsequently, Fineman moved to Columbia Law School,  where she was appointed as the Maurice T. Moore Professor of Law in 1990. She went on to become the first Dorothea S. Clarke Professor of Feminist Jurisprudence at Cornell Law School in 1999. Since 2004, she has been a Robert W. Woodruff Professor of Law at Emory University School of Law. The honor is \"reserved for world-class scholars who are not only proven leaders of their own fields of specialty, but also ambitious bridge-builders across specialty disciplines.\"\n\nFeminism and Legal Theory Project\n\nFineman is the founding director of the Feminism and Legal Theory Project, which she founded in 1984 and which has been housed by the University of Wisconsin Law School, Columbia Law School, Cornell Law School, and Emory University School of Law. Fineman founded the FLT Project at the University of Wisconsin Law School and for the next six years the Project hosted an annual summer conference to \"provide a forum for interdisciplinary feminist scholarship addressing important issues in law and society.\" Over time, Fineman expanded the scope of the Project – increasing the number and variety of annual workshops and presentations, and adding new programs.\n\nFineman seeks to bring together other feminists to validate established expertise and encourage newly emerging scholars. The Feminism and Legal Theory Project brings together scholars to study and debate a wide range of topics related to feminist theory and law. The FLT Project hosts four or five scholarly workshops per year with a core commitment \"to foster interdisciplinary examinations of specific law and policy topics of particular interest to women.\"  FLT Project inquiries do not address gender exclusively – project scholarship is concerned with equality issues related to the intersections of race, gender, class, sexuality and ability. The FLT Project published At the Boundaries of Law: Feminism and Legal Theory (1990) and Transcending the Boundaries of Law: Generations of Feminism and Legal Theory (2011) as well as other books.\n\nVulnerability and the Human Condition Initiative\n\nFineman directs the Vulnerability and the Human Condition Initiative which was founded in 2008 at Emory Law School. This program hosts national and international workshops and visitors.  Its purpose is to provide a forum for scholars interested in engaging the concepts of \"vulnerability\" and \"resilience\" and the idea of a \"responsive state\" in constructing a universal approach to address the human condition.\n\nFineman is an affiliated scholar of the Center for American Progress.\n\nIn September 2018, she was ranked the #1 Most-Cited Family Law Faculty in the U.S. for the period 2013-2017 on Brian Leiter's Law School Reports, based on Sisk Annual Report data.\n\nWork on dependency and vulnerability\nShe now focuses on the legal implications of universal dependency, vulnerability and justice.\n\nIn her 2004 book The Autonomy Myth: A Theory of Dependency, Fineman \"argues that popular ideology in the United States has become fixated on the myth that citizens are and should be autonomous. Yet the fact that dependency is unavoidable in any society and must be dealt with to sustain the polity, Fineman contends, gives the state the responsibility to support caretaking.\"\n\nHer 2008 article \"The Vulnerable Subject\" in the Yale Journal of Law and Feminism forms the basis for her 2011 book, also titled The Vulnerable Subject.\n\nFineman argues:\n\nVulnerability is and should be understood to be universal and constant, inherent in the human condition.",

However, he initially focused on the 2012 summer olympics instead of the nfl draft, and skipped the 2012 nfl combine. After winning a silver medal in the olympics, demps attracted interest from nfl teams.\n\nOn august 17, 2012, he signed a three-year contract with the new england patriots. However, he didn't play much for the patriots and eventually moved to the tampa bay buccaneers, where he had some regular season playing time. Later in his career, demps also signed with the indianapolis colts.\n\nUnfortunately, demps' nfl career was neither as long nor as successful as his college career in both football and track and field. He was unable to reach the same heights in the professional league but still made a mark with his athletic abilities and olympic accomplishments.\n\nThough his time in the nfl may not have been as noteworthy, demps continued to excel in track and field, competing at a high level and securing numerous victories in various events, including the cayman invitational and the bermuda invitational track meets in 2018.

Demps matched the 100 meters world junior record with a time of 10.01 seconds in June 2008.\n\nIn January 2012, Demps decided to focus on the 2012 United States Olympic Trials instead of the 2012 NFL Draft, pursuing a career in track rather than professional football. After winning a silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Demps signed a contract with the NFL's New England Patriots on August 17, 2012. He was a running back for the New England Patriots, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Indianapolis Colts. He only had regular season playing time with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nHigh school career\nDemps attended South Lake High School in Groveland, Florida, where he was a second-team Class 4A all-state selection at running back, gaining 1,401 yards on the ground, along with 16 touchdowns on 157 carries during his senior year. As a junior, he rushed for 21 touchdowns and 1,761 yards on 170 carries, earning second-team all-state Class 3A selection honors. Regarded as a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Demps was listed as the No. 36 football prospect from the state of Florida in 2008.\n\nIn track, he ran the 100 meters at the Florida state final, the fastest time recorded at that event at 10.37 seconds. He also clocked a 10.25 at the AAU Junior Olympics, the second-fastest time ever in the state and the fastest clocking recorded by a high school senior that year. Competing at the 2008 U.S. Olympic trials, Demps set a new national high school record with 10.01 seconds, beating J-Mee Samuels' 10.08 seconds. His time also equaled the 100 meters world junior record, originally established by Darrel Brown in 2003.\n\nCollege career\n\nAmerican football\nDemps played a key role in Florida's third national title season, rushing 78 times for 605 yards, averaging 7.8 yards per carry as a freshman. During his sophomore season Demps rushed for a career high 745 yards on 99 carries and 7 scores. He also averaged 7.5 yards a carry that season. During his junior season, Demps battled several injuries which caused him to rush for a career low 551 yards on 92 carries and 3 touchdowns. as a senior, Jeff Demps rushed for 569 yards on 98 carries and 6 touchdowns. This included a career long 84 yard touchdown score against Kentucky.\n\nStatistics\n\nTrack and field\n\nIn 2009, Demps competed in four outdoor meets for the Gators' track and field team. He ran the anchor leg of Florida's SEC Championship 4 × 100 m relay team (alongside Jeremy Hall, Calvin Smith Jr., and Terrell Wilks), which recorded the third-fastest time in school history (38.74) and won Florida's first the 4×100-meter relay title since the 2004 season. Following an injury, Demps only ran a 10.30 over 100 meters at the SEC Championships, placing him ninth overall. At the War Eagle Invitational, Demps helped the Gators win the 4×100-meter relay.\n\nIn March 2010, Demps won the 60 meters in 6.56 seconds at the 2010 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Three months later at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, he beat favored Rondel Sorrillo by a margin of .13 seconds, claiming the school's first 100-meter NCAA title since Bernard Williams won in 2000. Demps' time of 9.96 would have been a new school record had the race not been heavily wind-aided (+2.5 m/s). He claimed the 2012 NCAA Indoor title over 60 meters with a personal best run of 6.52 in the heats, then time of 6.56 seconds to win the final. At the 85th Texas Relays in March 2012, Demps won the 100 metres in the university group, ahead of Aaron Ernest of LSU.\n\nOn July 25, 2012, Demps was added to the 2012 U.S. Olympic roster as a member of the 4×100 meter relay pool, serving as a replacement for Mike Rodgers, who suffered a stress fracture in his left foot. He raced the first leg of the preliminary second heat and helped the U.S. 4×100 relay team achieve a time of the 37.38 seconds, which was the fastest time of the preliminary round and broke a 20-year-old American record. The team would go on to win a silver medal in the final round with Tyson Gay and Ryan Bailey instead of Demps and preliminary teammate Darvis Patton, but as part of the team, Demps still received a medal. The medal was later stripped, after Gay admitted to using a banned substance. Demps is still competing at a high level to this day. During the 2018 season, Demps has won the Cayman Invitational and the Bermuda Invitational track meets both in the 100m. He also placed 6th in the USATF National Championships with a time of 10.02 seconds.\n\nPersonal bests\n\nProfessional football career\nDemps skipped the 2012 NFL Combine and Draft in favor of preparing for the 2012 Summer Olympics. However, he attracted interest from NFL teams after the Olympics, and agreed to terms on a three-year deal with the New England Patriots on August 17, 2012.",

It takes advantage of an unintended side effect due to the high cell density in modern dram. This side effect causes memory cells to interact electrically, leaking their charges and potentially altering the contents of nearby memory rows. The row hammer effect is triggered by specifically crafted memory access patterns that rapidly activate the same memory rows multiple times, causing this electrical interaction between cells. It's a security concern because it can be used for privilege escalation and even network-based attacks. \n\n<user> Thank you for the explanation. i have a clearer understanding now, but i'm still curious about how memory cells are organized and how these security exploits take place. can you provide a more detailed description of how memory cell organization affects the row hammer effect, and how data is read and written to these memory cells? additionally, are there any effective techniques to prevent row hammer from occurring, and do we need any special hardware for that? \n\n<assistant> Memory cells in dram are organized into matrices and addressed through rows and columns. Read operations involve row activation and transfer of bits from the row to the sense amplifiers forming the row buffer, depending on the column address. Due to the design, dram memory cells must be rewritten after being read. Row hammer exploits this by rapidly activating the same row, causing charge leakage across nearby rows.\n\nThere are hardware-based techniques to prevent row hammer, such as processors or dram modules with built-in safeguards. These methods effectively mitigate the row hammer effect. \n\n<user> That's interesting. now, let's talk about the real-world implications of row hammer. how severe is the risk of row hammer attacks? have there been any notable instances where this exploit has caused significant damage? also, considering the vulnerability, is it possible to perform row hammer attacks remotely, or do attackers need physical access to the target device? \n\n<assistant> The risk of row hammer attacks depends on various factors such as the target system, protective measures in place, and the attacker's skills. Although the risk isn't prevalent, row hammer's potential to cause privilege escalation and network-based attacks is a concern. There have been reported instances of row hammer-based exploits, but they haven't caused large-scale damage in the real world.\n\nIn theory, row hammer attacks could be executed remotely or through network-based attacks. Real-world examples of remote row hammer attacks are rare, but they are a potential risk. An attacker would typically need to exploit a software vulnerability first to gain access to the target system and execute specific memory access patterns that trigger the row hammer effect.\n\nIt is crucial to implement hardware-based prevention techniques as mentioned earlier, along with continuous updates to system software and vigilance in cybersecurity practices. Computer systems should be regularly assessed for vulnerabilities, and dram manufacturers are encouraged to develop technologies with built-in countermeasures against row hammer attacks to minimize the risk.\n\nIn conclusion, while the row hammer attack presents a valid security concern, its successful execution depends on various factors. Ensuring that systems are up-to-date, employing hardware-based prevention techniques, and employing diligent security practices will significantly reduce the likelihood of a successful row hammer attack.

        "reference": "Row hammer (also written as rowhammer) is a security exploit that takes advantage of an unintended and undesirable side effect in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) in which memory cells interact electrically between themselves by leaking their charges, possibly changing the contents of nearby memory rows that were not addressed in the original memory access. This circumvention of the isolation between DRAM memory cells results from the high cell density in modern DRAM, and can be triggered by specially crafted memory access patterns that rapidly activate the same memory rows numerous times.\n\nThe row hammer effect has been used in some privilege escalation computer security exploits, and network-based attacks are also theoretically possible.\n\nDifferent hardware-based techniques exist to prevent the row hammer effect from occurring, including required support in some processors and types of DRAM memory modules.\n\nBackground \n\nIn dynamic RAM (DRAM), each bit of stored data occupies a separate memory cell that is electrically implemented with one capacitor and one transistor. The charge state of a capacitor (charged or discharged) is what determines whether a DRAM cell stores \"1\" or \"0\" as a binary value. Huge numbers of DRAM memory cells are packed into integrated circuits, together with some additional logic that organizes the cells for the purposes of reading, writing, and refreshing the data.\n\nMemory cells (blue squares in both illustrations) are further organized into matrices and addressed through rows and columns. A memory address applied to a matrix is broken into the row address and column address, which are processed by the row and column address decoders (in both illustrations, vertical and horizontal green rectangles, respectively). After a row address selects the row for a read operation (the selection is also known as row activation), bits from all cells in the row are transferred into the sense amplifiers that form the row buffer (red squares in both illustrations), from which the exact bit is selected using the column address. Consequently, read operations are of a destructive nature because the design of DRAM requires memory cells to be rewritten after their values have been read by transferring the cell charges into the row buffer. Write operations decode the addresses in a similar way, but as a result of the design entire rows must be rewritten for the value of a single bit to be changed.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> What were the main ideas and goals of the frankfurt school, and why did they feel it was necessary? \n\n<assistant> The frankfurt school, a school of social theory and critical philosophy, was founded in response to the dissatisfaction with the socio-economic systems of capitalist, fascist, and communist societies during the interwar period in the 1930s. The theorists believed that existing social theory couldn't explain the turbulent political factionalism and reactionary politics occurring in 20th-century liberal capitalist societies.\n\nThe main ideas and goals of the frankfurt school revolved around developing a critical theory that went beyond the inflexibility of capitalism and marxism-leninism towards alternative paths for social development. To address the limitations of classical marxism and other 19th-century theories, they synthesized ideas from various sources like immanuel kant, georg wilhelm friedrich hegel, karl marx, sigmund freud, max weber, georg simmel, and georg lukács. They integrated the social sciences and drew upon antipositivist sociology, psychoanalysis, and existentialism.\n\nThe school was interested in the conditions that allowed for social change through rational social institutions, emphasizing the critical component of social theory. They aimed to overcome the ideological constraints of positivism, materialism, and determinism by returning to kant's critical philosophy and incorporating dialectic and contradiction from hegel's philosophy.\n\nSince the 1960s, jürgen habermas's work in communicative rationality, linguistic intersubjectivity, and \"the philosophical discourse of modernity\" has guided the critical-theory work of the institute for social research. However, certain critical theorists like raymond geuss and nikolas kompridis have opposed habermas's propositions, claiming that he undermined the original social-change purposes of critical theory. \n\n<user> How did the political events during the weimar republic and the rise of nazism have an impact on the development of critical theory in the frankfurt school? \n\n<assistant> The Frankfurt School and the development of critical theory were significantly influenced by the political events and social conditions in the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazism. The tumultuous interwar years between 1918 and 1939 featured continued political instability, which shaped the scholars' thinking and concerns. \n\nThe failed German Revolution of 1918-19, foreseen by Marx, exposed the shortcomings of existing Marxist theory in understanding and responding to the social and political dynamics during that period. The Frankfurt School took this as an urgent call to reassess and expand the understanding of Marxist theories in the context of evolving socio-political situations.\n\nThe rise of Nazism, a German form of fascism, was another manifestation of the turbulent politics in 20th-century German society. The stark contrast it presented to other socio-economic systems and its rapid ascent to power challenged established social theories, highlighting the need to develop a novel approach capable of critiquing and understanding such phenomena. As a result, the Frankfurt School scholars focused on creating a critical theory that addressed the inadequacies of traditional social theories and sought alternative paths to social development that could better respond to the complex political realities of the 20th century. \n\n<user> Can you explain more about jürgen habermas's work guiding the critical-theory work of the institute for social research, and what are the main criticisms made by raymond geuss and nikolas kompridis? \n\n<assistant> Jürgen habermas is a prominent german philosopher and sociologist, deeply associated with the frankfurt school. His work has focused on communicative rationality, linguistic intersubjectivity, and \"the philosophical discourse of modernity.\" habermas expanded the scope of the school's critical theory by integrating insights about language, communication, and public sphere, articulating the importance of democratic deliberation and highlighting the role of communication in forming the rational basis for social consensus.\n\nRaymond geuss and nikolas kompridis, however, have critiqued habermas's approach, arguing that it weakens the original goals of critical theory. They believe that habermas's emphasis on communication and consensus sidelines other important aspects of critical theory, such as the exploration of potentially emancipatory social and political alternatives.\n\nGeuss argues that habermas's work discounts the critical potential of other forms of discourse or normative challenges, suggesting that habermas's theoretical framework might, in some cases, suppress dissenting or radical perspectives instead of promoting emancipation. Kompridis, on the other hand, contends that habermas's approach is too focused on procedural aspects of rationality and communication, which makes it politically and conceptually conservative. This, according to kompridis, hinders the possibility for transformative social change in the way that the original critical theory intended. \n\n<user> How did max horkheimer contribute to the frankfurt school, and what kind of intellectuals did he recruit once he became the director? \n\n<assistant> Max horkheimer was a german philosopher and sociologist who played a pivotal role in the development of the frankfurt school by becoming its director in 1930. Horkheimer was instrumental in shaping the school's interdisciplinary approach, emphasizing the integration of social sciences in their critical theory.\n\nUnder horkheimer's leadership, the frankfurt school aimed to create a synthesis of marxian and freudian perspectives to challenge both economic and psychological determinism. He was interested in analyzing the underlying social and psychological causes of political and economic crises and exploring the feasibility of radical social change.\n\nHorkheimer recruited a diverse range of talented intellectuals from various fields to contribute to the school's pursuit of a comprehensive critical theory. Some of the prominent figures he brought on board included:\n\n1. Theodor w. Adorno - a philosopher, sociologist, and musicologist, adorno contributed significantly to critical theory, aesthetics, and sociology.\n2. Erich fromm - a psychoanalyst specializing in the intersection of psychology and society, fromm explored the deep psychological impact of social and institutional forces on individuals.\n3. Herbert marcuse - a philosopher who intertwined social and political philosophy, marcuse contributed to the critique of advanced industrial societies and delineated the prospects for social change.\n\nHorkheimer's vision and recruitment of these diverse thinkers helped solidify the frankfurt school's identity as a multi-disciplinary intellectual hub focused on advancing a comprehensive approach to social critique and change.

        "reference": "The Frankfurt School () was a school of social theory and critical philosophy associated with the Institute for Social Research, at Goethe University Frankfurt in 1929. Founded in the Weimar Republic (1918–1933), during the European interwar period (1918–1939), the Frankfurt School comprised intellectuals, academics, and political dissidents dissatisfied with the contemporary socio-economic systems (capitalist, fascist, communist) of the 1930s. The Frankfurt theorists proposed that social theory was inadequate for explaining the turbulent political factionalism and reactionary politics occurring in 20th century liberal capitalist societies. Critical of both capitalism and of Marxism–Leninism as philosophically inflexible systems of social organization, the School's critical theory research indicated alternative paths to realizing the social development of a society and a nation.\n\nThe Frankfurt School perspective of critical investigation (open-ended and self-critical) is based upon Freudian, Marxist and Hegelian premises of idealist philosophy. To fill the omissions of 19th-century classical Marxism, which did not address 20th-century social problems, they applied the methods of antipositivist sociology, of psychoanalysis, and of existentialism. The School's sociologic works derived from syntheses of the thematically pertinent works of Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and Karl Marx, of Sigmund Freud and Max Weber, and of Georg Simmel and Georg Lukács.\n\nLike Karl Marx, the Frankfurt School concerned themselves with the conditions (political, economic, societal) that allow for social change realized by way of rational social institutions. Their emphasis on the critical component of social theory derived from their attempts to overcome the ideological limitations of positivism, materialism, and determinism by returning to the critical philosophy of Kant and his successors in German idealism – principally the philosophy of Hegel, which emphasized dialectic and contradiction as intellectual properties inherent to the human grasp of material reality.\n\nSince the 1960s, the critical-theory work of the Institute for Social Research has been guided by Jürgen Habermas's work in communicative rationality, linguistic intersubjectivity, and \"the philosophical discourse of modernity.\" Critical theorists Raymond Geuss and Nikolas Kompridis have opposed Habermas's propositions, claiming he has undermined the original social-change purposes of critical-theory-problems, such as what should reason mean; analysis of the conditions necessary to realize social emancipation; and critiques of contemporary capitalism.\n\nHistory\n\nInstitute for Social Research\n\nThe term \"Frankfurt School\" describes the works of scholarship and the intellectuals who were the Institute for Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung), an adjunct organization at Goethe University Frankfurt, founded in 1923, by Carl Grünberg, a Marxist professor of law at the University of Vienna. It was the first Marxist research center at a German university and was funded through the largesse of the wealthy student Felix Weil (1898–1975).\n\nWeil's doctoral dissertation dealt with the practical problems of implementing socialism. In 1922, he organized the First Marxist Workweek  (Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche) in effort to synthesize different trends of Marxism into a coherent, practical philosophy; the first symposium included György Lukács, Karl Korsch, Karl August Wittfogel and Friedrich Pollock. The success of the First Marxist Workweek prompted the formal establishment of a permanent institute for social research, and Weil negotiated with the Ministry of Education for a university professor to be director of the Institute for Social Research, thereby, formally ensuring that the Frankfurt School would be a university institution.\n\nKorsch and Lukács participated in the Arbeitswoche, which included the study of Marxism and Philosophy (1923), by Karl Korsch, but their Communist Party membership precluded their active participation in the Institute for Social Research (Frankfurt School); yet Korsch participated in the School's publishing venture. Moreover, the political correctness by which the Communists compelled Lukács to repudiate his book History and Class Consciousness (1923) indicated that political, ideological, and intellectual independence from the communist party was a necessary work condition for realizing the production of knowledge.\n\nThe philosophical tradition of the Frankfurt School – the multi-disciplinary integration of the social sciences – is associated with the philosopher Max Horkheimer, who became the director in 1930, and recruited intellectuals such as Theodor W. Adorno (philosopher, sociologist, musicologist), Erich Fromm (psychoanalyst), and Herbert Marcuse (philosopher).\n\nEuropean interwar period (1918–39)\nIn the Weimar Republic (1918–33), the continual political turmoils of the interwar years (1918–39) much affected the development of the critical theory philosophy of the Frankfurt School. The scholars were especially influenced by the Communists’ failed German Revolution of 1918–19 (which Marx predicted) and by the rise of Nazism (1933–45), a German form of fascism.",

This new time didn't just break the previous world record — it smashed it by a whole nine seconds! People were amazed by haile's incredible speed and endurance.\n\nIn the same year, haile continued to showcase his talent in zürich, switzerland, where he competed in a 5,000-meter race. He finished with an unbelievable time of 12 minutes, 44.39 seconds. This result was even more astounding because it broke the existing world record by a massive 10.91 seconds. The previous record was 12 minutes, 55 seconds, which had been set by saïd aouita.\n\nThese accomplishments in 1995 certainly solidified haile gebrselassie's reputation as one of history's greatest distance runners. His records stood as stellar examples of his extraordinary abilities, bringing him global recognition and admiration from those who followed the sport of distance running.

He won the Berlin Marathon four times consecutively and also had three straight wins at the Dubai Marathon. Further to this, he won four world titles indoors and was the 2001 World Half Marathon Champion.\n\nHaile had major competition wins at distances between 1500 metres and the marathon, moving from outdoor, indoor and cross country running to road running in the latter part of his career. He broke 61 Ethiopian national records ranging from 800 metres to the marathon, set 27 world records, and is regarded as one of the greatest distance runners in history.\n\nIn September 2008, at the age of 35, he won the Berlin Marathon with a world record time of 2:03:59, breaking his own world record by 27 seconds. The record stood for three years. Since he was over the age of 35, that mark stood as the Masters Age group world record until 29 September 2019, when fellow Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele ran 2:01:41 at the age of 37. Gebrselassie's 10000 m Masters record has not been challenged since 2008.\n\nHaile was cited as one of the Top 100 most influential Africans by New African magazine in 2011.\n\nDuring the Hachalu Hundessa riots in the summer of 2020, businesses and properties of non-Oromo's were targeted by Oromo mobs. Haile Gebrselassie hotels and resort was burned, 400 employees lost their jobs.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly career\n\nHaile was born as one of ten children in Asella, Oromiya Region, Ethiopia. As a child growing up on a farm he used to run ten kilometres to school every morning, and the same back every evening. This led to a distinctive running posture, with his left arm crooked as if he is still holding his school books.\n\nIn 1992, Haile gained international recognition in Seoul, South Korea, when he won the 5000-metre and 10,000-metre races at the 1992 World Junior Championships and a silver medal in the junior race at the World Cross Country Championships held in Boston, the United States.\n\nThe next year, in 1993, Haile won the first of what would eventually be four consecutive world championships titles in the men's 10,000 metres at the 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999 World Championships. His win at the 1993 was however his most infamous as he accidentally stepped on the heel of Moses Tanui's shoe at the bell, causing it to fly off his foot. After the contact, with just one shoe, an angered Tanui moved out to a 10-meter lead, only to have Haile run him down on the final straight. Also at the 1993 World Championships he ran in the 5,000-metre race to finish a close second behind Ismael Kirui of Kenya. In 1994 he won a bronze medal at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Later that year he set his first world record by running a 12:56.96 in the 5,000-metres, breaking Saïd Aouita's record by almost two seconds.\n\nIn 1995, Haile ran the 10,000-metres in 26:43.53 in Hengelo, Netherlands, lowering the world record by nine seconds.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you explain in real-life terms what a congruence relation is and how it relates to algebraic structures? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! A congruence relation is a way of comparing the elements within an algebraic structure (such as a group, ring, or vector space) and determining if they are \"equivalent\" in some sense. Algebraic structures have operations that allow you to manipulate their elements, like addition and multiplication for the integers. A congruence relation is said to be \"compatible\" with the algebraic structure when applying the operations on equivalent elements still gives you equivalent elements. \n\nA common example of a congruence relation in real life is congruence modulo n, where n is a positive integer. When talking about integers, two integers a and b are congruent modulo n if they have the same remainder when divided by n. You can think of this like a clock. If it's 2 hours past midnight (2 am) and you add 24 hours, you would still say it's 2 am. In this case, 2 and 26 are congruent modulo 24, as they have the same position on a 24-hour clock. \n\nCongruence relations, being equivalence relations, help us define quotient structures, which comprise the equivalence classes that arise from the relation. Equivalence classes are sets of elements that are deemed equivalent to each other under the congruence relation. The beauty of quotient structures is that they preserve the algebraic operations. For example, arithmetic modulo n (addition and multiplication) can be performed on equivalence classes in a consistent and correct manner.\n\nThe concept of congruence relations extends to other algebraic structures like groups, rings, and vector spaces. For each type of structure, the definition of congruence depends on the specific operations involved. However, the main idea remains the same: congruences are equivalence relations compatible with the algebraic structure. They have important connections with homomorphisms, substructures (such as normal subgroups and ideals), and quotient structures. In general, congruences allow us to simplify the study of algebraic structures by grouping similar elements together and analyzing their behavior under the algebraic operations of the structure. \n\n<user> Hey, i'm a student, and i was wondering if you could give me some more examples of congruence relations, especially for groups and rings? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Let's take a look at some examples of congruence relations for both groups and rings.\n\nExample: groups\nA group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set and a binary operation (like addition or multiplication) that follows specific rules. For a group g with operation *, a congruence relation is an equivalence relation that satisfies the following condition for all elements in the group:\n(a * b) ~ (a' * b') whenever a ~ a' and b ~ b'.\n\nGroups have an identity element (e), a unique element that results from combining any element and its inverse. For congruences in groups, the equivalence class containing the identity element is always a normal subgroup (a specific type of subgroup), and the other equivalence classes are the other cosets of this normal subgroup. Together, these equivalence classes form a quotient group.\n\nExample: rings\nA ring is an algebraic structure with two operations (addition and multiplication) that obey certain rules. A congruence relation on a ring must satisfy compatibility with both operations. Specifically,\n(a + b) ~ (a' + b') and (a * b) ~ (a' * b') whenever a ~ a' and b ~ b'.\nFor a ring, the equivalence class containing the additive identity (0) is always a two-sided ideal (a special subset of the ring), and the operations on equivalence classes define a quotient ring.\n\nIn groups and rings, congruence relations serve as a powerful tool to investigate algebraic structures by breaking them down into simpler, related structures called quotient structures. These relations pave the way for a deeper understanding of the behavior and properties of algebraic structures and their elements.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions or need more examples! \n\n<user> I appreciate the examples, but i'm still a bit confused about the connection between congruence relations and homomorphisms. can you elaborate on that? \n\n<assistant> Sure! Let's dive into the relationship between congruence relations and homomorphisms.\n\nA homomorphism is a function between two algebraic structures (such as groups, rings, or vector spaces) that preserves the structure's operations. In other words, a homomorphism maps the elements of one structure to the elements of another while respecting the structure's algebraic operations.\n\nTo see how congruence relations and homomorphisms are connected, consider a homomorphism f, mapping an algebraic structure a to another structure b. We can define a relation r on a such that:\nA r a' if and only if f(a) = f(a').\n\nThis relation r is a congruence relation on a. Indeed, by the first isomorphism theorem, the image of a under f is a substructure of b isomorphic to the quotient of a by the congruence relation r.\n\nConversely, given a congruence relation on a structure a, we obtain a unique homomorphism f, mapping a to the quotient structure (say a/~). The homomorphism f maps each element of a to its corresponding equivalence class in a/~. \n\nIn summary, congruences and homomorphisms are naturally related. Given a homomorphism, you can define a congruence relation on the domain structure. And given a congruence relation, you can construct a homomorphism mapping the elements of a structure to the corresponding quotient structure. This connection between congruences and homomorphisms allows us to study algebraic structures and their properties more effectively. \n\n<user> I'm still not completely clear about this concept. can you explain congruence relations and their connection to homomorphisms in a way that even a child could understand? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Imagine you have a box of different shapes, like triangles, squares, and circles. You want to sort them into groups based on their type. In this case, the shapes are like the elements of an algebraic structure, and the \"sorting\" represents the congruence relation.\n\nEach group you make (for example, all squares in one group) is like an equivalence class for the congruence relation. The process of making these groups is similar to breaking down an algebraic structure into simpler related structures, or quotient structures. \n\nNow, let's imagine you have a magical machine that can transform one box of shapes into another. You put your box of shapes into the machine, and it outputs another box with some rules (like doubling the size of each square, making triangles smaller, etc.). This machine is like a homomorphism between two algebraic structures. It maps the shapes from the first box (our original algebraic structure) to the shapes in the second box (the new algebraic structure) while still following some rules (the structure's operations). \n\nThe congruence relation groups the shapes in the first box, while the magical machine preserves these groups when creating the new shapes in the second box. So, the congruence relation sorts elements in the first algebraic structure, while the homomorphism maintains these groupings when mapping to the new structure. Together, they help us understand and analyze the relationships between algebraic structures in a simpler way!\n\nI hope this analogy helps clarify the ideas behind congruence relations and their connection to homomorphisms. Let me know if you have any other questions! ",

        "reference": "In abstract algebra, a congruence relation (or simply congruence) is an equivalence relation on an algebraic structure (such as a group, ring, or vector space) that is compatible with the structure in the sense that algebraic operations done with equivalent elements will yield equivalent elements.  Every congruence relation has a corresponding quotient structure, whose elements are the equivalence classes (or congruence classes) for the relation.\n\nBasic example\n\nThe prototypical example of a congruence relation is congruence modulo  on the set of integers.  For a given positive integer , two integers  and  are called congruent modulo , written\n \nif  is divisible by  (or equivalently if  and  have the same remainder when divided by ).\n\nFor example,  and  are congruent modulo ,\n\n \n\nsince  is a multiple of 10, or equivalently since both  and  have a remainder of  when divided by .\n\nCongruence modulo  (for a fixed ) is compatible with both addition and multiplication on the integers.  That is,\n\nif\n\n  and \n\nthen\n\n   and  \n\nThe corresponding addition and multiplication of equivalence classes is known as modular arithmetic.  From the point of view of abstract algebra, congruence modulo  is a congruence relation on the ring of integers, and arithmetic modulo  occurs on the corresponding quotient ring.\n\nDefinition\nThe definition of a congruence depends on the type of algebraic structure under consideration.  Particular definitions of congruence can be made for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, semigroups, lattices, and so forth.  The common theme is that a congruence is an equivalence relation on an algebraic object that is compatible with the algebraic structure, in the sense that the operations are well-defined on the equivalence classes.\n\nExample: Groups\nFor example, a group is an algebraic object consisting of a set together with a single binary operation, satisfying certain axioms.  If  is a group with operation , a congruence relation on  is an equivalence relation  on the elements of  satisfying\n and  \nfor all . For a congruence on a group, the equivalence class containing the identity element is always a normal subgroup, and the other equivalence classes are the other cosets of this subgroup.  Together, these equivalence classes are the elements of a quotient group.\n\nExample: Rings\nWhen an algebraic structure includes more than one operation, congruence relations are required to be compatible with each operation.  For example, a ring possesses both addition and multiplication, and a congruence relation on a ring must satisfy\n and \nwhenever  and . For a congruence on a ring, the equivalence class containing 0 is always a two-sided ideal, and the two operations on the set of equivalence classes define the corresponding quotient ring.\n\nGeneral\nThe general notion of a congruence relation can be formally defined in the context of universal algebra, a field which studies ideas common to all algebraic structures.  In this setting, a relation  on a given algebraic structure is called compatible if\nfor each  and each -ary operation  defined on the structure: whenever  and ... and , then .\n\nA congruence relation on the structure is then defined as an equivalence relation that is also compatible.\n\nRelation with homomorphisms\nIf  is a homomorphism between two algebraic structures (such as homomorphism of groups, or a linear map between vector spaces), then the relation  defined by\n\n if and only if  \n\nis a congruence relation on .  By the first isomorphism theorem, the image of A under  is a substructure of B isomorphic to the quotient of A by this congruence.\n\nOn the other hand, the relation  induces a unique homomorphism  given by\n\n.\n\nThus, there is a natural correspondence between the congruences and the homomorphisms of any given structure.\n\nCongruences of groups, and normal subgroups and ideals\nIn the particular case of groups, congruence relations can be described in elementary terms as follows:\nIf G is a group (with identity element e and operation *) and ~ is a binary relation on G, then ~ is a congruence whenever:\nGiven any element a of G, a ~ a (reflexivity);\nGiven any elements a and b of G, if a ~ b, then b ~ a (symmetry);\nGiven any elements a, b, and c of G, if a ~ b and b ~ c, then a ~ c (transitivity);\nGiven any elements a, a' , b, and b'  of G, if a ~ a'  and b ~ b' , then a * b ~ a'  * b' ;\nGiven any elements a and a'  of G, if a ~ a' , then a−1 ~ a' −1 (this can actually be proven from the other four, so is strictly redundant).\n\nConditions 1, 2, and 3 say that ~ is an equivalence relation.\n\nA congruence ~ is determined entirely by the set {a ∈ G : a ~ e} of those elements of G that are congruent to the identity element, and this set is a normal subgroup.\nSpecifically,  if and only if b−1 * a ~ e.\nSo instead of talking about congruences on groups, people usually speak in terms of normal subgroups of them; in fact, every congruence corresponds uniquely to some normal subgroup of G.\n\nIdeals of rings and the general case \n\nA similar trick allows one to speak of kernels in ring theory as ideals instead of congruence relations, and in module theory as submodules instead of congruence relations.\n\nA more general situation where this trick is possible is with Omega-groups (in the general sense allowing operators with multiple arity). But this cannot be done with, for example, monoids, so the study of congruence relations plays a more central role in monoid theory.\n\nUniversal algebra\n\nThe general notion of a congruence is particularly useful in universal algebra. An equivalent formulation in this context is the following:\n\nA congruence relation on an algebra A is a subset of the direct product A × A that is both an equivalence relation on A and a subalgebra of A × A.\n\nThe kernel of a homomorphism is always a congruence. Indeed, every congruence arises as a kernel.\nFor a given congruence ~ on A, the set A/~ of equivalence classes can be given the structure of an algebra in a natural fashion, the quotient algebra.\nThe function that maps every element of A to its equivalence class is a homomorphism, and the kernel of this homomorphism is ~.\n\nThe lattice Con(A) of all congruence relations on an algebra A is algebraic.\n\nJohn M. Howie described how semigroup theory illustrates congruence relations in universal algebra:\nIn a group a congruence is determined if we know a single congruence class, in particular if we know the normal subgroup which is the class containing the identity. Similarly, in a ring a congruence is determined if we know the ideal which is the congruence class containing the zero. In semigroups there is no such fortunate occurrence, and we are therefore faced with the necessity of studying congruences as such. More than anything else, it is this necessity that gives semigroup theory its characteristic flavour.",

Additionally, the Hohenzollern crypt, which serves as a dynastic tomb, covers most of the basement area. The Memorial Church used to be on the north side, but it was demolished by East German authorities in 1975.\n\nDuring World War II, the cathedral was damaged due to Allied bombing. As a result, the original interior of the building was destroyed. Nonetheless, preservation and restoration efforts took place, and the interior was fully restored by 2002.

The term \"dom\" in german is commonly used to refer to a cathedral, though it actually denotes a collegiate church, which is similar to a cathedral in some respects, such as being endowed with revenues and estates to support a college of canons. Berlin cathedral is the parish church of the congregation gemeinde der oberpfarr- und domkirche zu berlin, affiliated with the evangelical church of berlin-brandenburg-silesian upper lusatia.\n\nThe bishop of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg, under its name from 1945 to 2003, is based at st. Mary's church and kaiser wilhelm memorial church in berlin, rather than berlin cathedral itself. This distinction makes the berlin cathedral's status unique compared to many traditional cathedrals, which serve as the seat for a bishop. ",

        "reference": "The Berlin Cathedral (), also known as, the Evangelical Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church, is a monumental German Evangelical  church and dynastic tomb (House of Hohenzollern) on the Museum Island in central Berlin. Having its origins as a castle chapel for the Berlin Palace, several structures have served to house the church since the 1400s. The present collegiate church was built from 1894 to 1905 by order of German Emperor William II according to plans by Julius Raschdorff in Renaissance and Baroque Revival styles. The listed building is the largest Protestant church in Germany and one of the most important dynastic tombs in Europe. In addition to church services, the cathedral is used for state ceremonies, concerts and other events.\n\nSince the demolition of the Memorial Church (Denkmalskirche) section on the north side by the East German authorities in 1975, the Berlin Cathedral has consisted of the large Sermon Church (Predigtkirche) in the center, and the smaller Baptismal and Matrimonial Church (Tauf- und Traukirche) on the south side and the Hohenzollern crypt (Hohenzollerngruft), which covers almost the entire basement. Damaged during the Allied bombing in World War II, the cathedral’s original interior was restored by 2002. Currently there is discussion about restoring the historical exterior as well.\n\nTerm\nBerlin Cathedral () is the common name for the Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church () in Berlin, Germany. \n\nThe Dom is the parish church of the congregation Gemeinde der Oberpfarr- und Domkirche zu Berlin, a member of the umbrella organisation Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia. The term Dom denotes a collegiate church (equivalent to the Italian duomo, or the English \"Minster\"); however, as most cathedrals are also collegiate churches, the term \"Dom\" has become the common term for a cathedral in German, though they are not synonymous. Berlin Cathedral has never been a cathedral in the actual sense of that term since it has never been the seat of a bishop. The bishop of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg (under this name 1945–2003) is based at St. Mary's Church and Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in Berlin.\n\nHistory\nBerlin Cathedral has a long history starting as a Roman Catholic place of worship in the 15th century.\n\nEstablishment of a Collegiate Church in Berlin (1451–1536)\nThe history of today's Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church and its community dates back to 1451. In that year Prince-Elector Frederick II Irontooth of Brandenburg moved with his residence from Brandenburg upon Havel to Cölln (today's Fishers' Island, the southern part of Museums Island) into the newly erected City Palace, which also housed a Catholic chapel. In 1454 Frederick Irontooth, after having returned – via Rome – from his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, elevated the chapel to become a parish church, richly endowing it with relics and altars. Pope Nicholas V ordered Stephan Bodecker, then Prince-Bishop of Brandenburg, to consecrate the chapel to Erasmus of Formiae.\n\nOn 7 April 1465 – at Frederick Irontooth's request – Pope Paul II attributed to St Erasmus Chapel a canon-law College named Stift zu Ehren Unserer Lieben Frauen, des heiligen Kreuzes, St. Petri und Pauli, St. Erasmi und St. Nicolai dedicated to  of Nazareth, the Holy Cross, Simon Peter, Paul of Tarsus, Erasmus of Formiae, and Nicholas of Myra. A collegiate church is a church endowed with revenues and earning estates, in order to provide a number of canons, called in canon law a College, with prebends. In this respect a collegiate church is similar to a cathedral, which is why in colloquial German the term cathedral college (Domstift), became the synecdoche used – pars pro toto – for all canon-law colleges.

By joining a destination club, members gain access to a collection of vacation homes in various locations worldwide in exchange for a one-time membership fee and annual membership dues. \n\nThere are different types of membership models to choose from, such as equity, non-equity, and next-generation clubs that challenge the standard models. All models require an initial payment and an annual fee that varies depending on the club type. In non-equity clubs, members don't own an interest in the vacation homes, but they still enjoy the club's hospitality benefits. Members of non-equity clubs usually pay a deposit, which may or may not be refundable upon leaving the club.\n\nBenefits and access privileges of joining a destination club typically include access to private homes, townhomes, condominiums, or hotel units; various usage rules; the ability to book homes in advance; high service levels, including pre-trip planning, daily housekeeping service, and on-location concierge services; luxury furnishings; and additional membership privileges, such as access to resort amenities, special club events, spas, and fitness centers. \n\n<user> That sounds amazing. could you give me an example of a non-equity club and how the pricing and travel options might work for a member? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Exclusive resorts, which was launched in 2002, is an example of a non-equity club. Members of exclusive resorts pay a joining fee that covers a specific number of travel nights per year. The club exclusively owns each property in its portfolio. Each year, members commit to and pay for a certain number of nights at a flat rate.\n\nAs a member of exclusive resorts or similar non-equity clubs, you can expect to receive excellent hospitality benefits without owning any part of the vacation homes. This model provides flexibility, allowing you to enjoy various vacation properties without being affected by real estate appreciation or losses in the club's residence portfolio.\n\nKeep in mind that the pricing and travel options vary across destination clubs, so it's important to research different clubs to find an offering that aligns with your preferences and budget. Membership fees, annual dues, and specific travel options will differ depending on the club and the selected membership level. \n\n<user> How do reservation priority and availability work with destination clubs? \n\n<assistant> Reservation priority and availability in destination clubs operate in a way that is consistent with other vacation options. Members can book inventory based on availability, and some clubs allow members to purchase different membership types that offer varying levels of reservation priority. These priority levels can influence the ease with which members can reserve specific vacation homes and dates.\n\nThe ability to book homes in advance and on a \"space available\" basis is generally offered, and clubs have systems in place to handle the demand for holiday or peak periods. The exact policies for booking, reservation priority, and availability vary by club, so it is important to understand and compare these policies when choosing a destination club that suits your needs.\n\nSome destination clubs offer personalized services and access to resort amenities such as beach clubs, luxury spas, and private chefs, which may be tied to specific membership tiers or reservation priority levels. Essentially, higher levels of membership can provide better reservation priority, availability, and additional services. Make sure to research the club's reservation policies and membership levels to find a fit tailored to your preferences. ",

Inspirato with American Express is the world's largest destination club.\n\nBy joining a destination club, a member gains access to a collection of vacation homes in various locations around the world in exchange for a one-time membership fee and annual membership dues.

This is similar to the membership model choices at country clubs. In all models, club members provide an up-front sum and an annual fee though the exact amounts vary significantly by club-type.\n\nNon-Equity Club Model - In non-equity clubs, members enjoy the hospitality benefits of the club, but don’t own an interest in the homes and so are not impacted by the real estate appreciation or losses of the club's residence portfolio. The up-front payment is a deposit, and traditionally when they resign from the club, members receive 75% to 100% of that deposit back. However, in recent years, non-equity clubs have gotten away from refunds.\n Exclusive Resorts (launched in 2002) is an example of this model.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you please explain commutative and noncommutative operations with some examples? \n\n<assistant> Sure! Commutative operations are those where the order of the operands doesn't affect the result. In other words, if you have a binary operation ⊗, it is commutative if a ⊗ b = b ⊗ a for all a and b. Some common examples of commutative binary operations include addition and multiplication of real numbers, complex numbers, and scalar multiplication of vectors. Another example is the intersection and union of sets.\n\nNoncommutative operations, on the other hand, are those where the order of the operands does affect the result. In such cases, a ⊗ b is not equal to b ⊗ a. One example is concatenation, which is the act of joining character strings together. For instance, joining the string \"hello\" with the string \"world\" gives you \"helloworld\", but joining \"world\" with \"hello\" gives you \"worldhello\", and clearly, these two results are not the same.\n\nAnother example of a noncommutative operation is washing and drying clothes. If you wash clothes and then dry them, you get a completely different result than if you dry them first and then wash them. The order of the operations matters.\n\nRotating objects can also demonstrate noncommutativity. If you rotate a book 90° around a vertical axis and then 90° around a horizontal axis, you will get a different orientation than if you perform the rotations in the opposite order. Similarly, the twists of a rubik's cube are noncommutative, and this is one of the reasons the puzzle is challenging to solve.\n\nIn mathematics, some noncommutative binary operations include matrix multiplication and cross product of vectors.\n\nIt's important to understand whether an operation is commutative or noncommutative, as this can have significant implications in solving problems, and it affects the strategies and techniques you can use. Commutativity is a fundamental concept in many branches of mathematics, and it allows for simplifications in proofs and problem-solving. \n\n<user> Historical background of the commutative property in mathematics? \n\n<assistant> The commutative property has been employed implicitly since ancient times. The Egyptians, for instance, used the commutative property of multiplication to simplify computing products. Euclid, the famous Greek mathematician, is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his well-known book, \"Elements\". However, formal use of the commutative property began in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when mathematicians started developing a theory of functions. Nowadays, the commutative property is considered a basic and well-known concept used in most branches of mathematics.\n\nThe term \"commutative\" was first used by François Servois in a memoir in 1814. He used the word \"commutatives\" while describing functions with what is now called the commutative property. The word comes from the combination of the French word \"commuter\", meaning \"to substitute or switch,\" and the suffix \"-ative\", meaning \"tending to\". Thus, \"commutative\" literally means \"tending to substitute or switch\". The term then appeared in English in the 1844 volume of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.\n\nThe commutative property has long been appreciated in various mathematical contexts, including set theory, group theory, algebraic structures, and propositional logic. This property has allowed mathematicians to simplify proofs and calculations, making it an essential concept to understand for anyone studying mathematics. \n\n<user> What are the rules of replacement in propositional logic related to commutativity? \n\n<assistant> In truth-functional propositional logic, commutation or commutativity refers to two valid rules of replacement. The rules allow you to transpose propositional variables within logical expressions in logical proofs. The rules of replacement related to commutativity are:\n\n1. Commutation of conjunction: (p ∧ q) ≡ (q ∧ p)\n2. Commutation of disjunction: (p ∨ q) ≡ (q ∨ p)\n\nIn these rules, p and q represent propositional variables, and the symbols ∧ and ∨ denote logical conjunction (and) and logical disjunction (or), respectively. The symbol ≡ is a metalogical symbol representing \"can be replaced in a proof with\".\n\nCommutation is a property of some logical connectives of truth-functional propositional logic. The two rules mentioned above demonstrate that commutativity is a property of both conjunction and disjunction in propositional logic. These rules are part of a larger set of logical equivalences and truth-functional tautologies used to manipulate and simplify logical expressions in proofs.\n\nBy understanding and applying these rules, one can develop logical arguments and manipulate expressions to draw valid conclusions in a more efficient manner.

The concept was conceived by rajiv rao, who also created the storylines and the name for the characters. The main purpose of the zoozoos was to promote various value-added services of vodafone during the indian premier league season 2 (ipl). They were used in a series of 30 advertisements, which were aired each day throughout the ipl season 2.\n\nEach zoozoo character is played by a human actor in a body suit, and they appear as white creatures with ballooned bodies and egg-shaped heads. The commercials were directed by prakash varma and produced by bangalore-based nirvana films, with the ads being shot in cape town, south africa. The ads became very popular among indian audiences, gaining a significant fan following on social media platforms such as facebook, orkut, and twitter. \n\n<user> How were the zoozoo characters made, and how were the ads produced? \n\n<assistant> The zoozoo characters were brought to life by having small-bodied, thin women wear layered white fabric body suits. Facial expressions were created using rubber pieces, which were pasted onto the actors' faces to reduce the time and cost of shooting. A special material was used for the body suits to ensure that there were no wrinkles when the actors moved. The body was stuffed with foam in certain areas, such as around the stomach, while the heads were made from a harder material called perspex.\n\nTo create a more animated look, the ads were shot at lower frame rates and used simple, grey, neutral-toned backgrounds. Larger-than-life sets were built to make the characters appear smaller. Children couldn't be used due to the unusual shooting schedule. The entire pre-production work was completed within a month, and the ads were produced within a record time of 10 days, costing around 3 crores indian rupees.\n\nOgilvy & mather, the agency that handles vodafone advertisements, collaborated with bangalore-based nirvana films, and cape town-based production house, platypus productions, to create the series of 30 ads intended for broadcast during ipl season 2. \n\n<user> What was the public reaction to the zoozoo ads? \n\n<assistant> The zoozoo ads were very well received by the indian audience.

It was organized at indianapolis, indiana, and mustered in on december 20, 1861, for three years of service.\n\nThroughout its service, the battery was attached to various divisions and corps within the union army. They were stationed in locations such as cairo, illinois; army of the tennessee; district of jackson, tennessee; department of the tennessee; and xvi corps. The non-veterans of the battery mustered out on march 6, 1865, while the remaining men mustered out on june 25, 1865.\n\nThe 9th indiana battery participated in several campaigns and battles, including the battle of shiloh, the siege of corinth, grant's central mississippi campaign, the red river campaign, and the battle of nashville, among others. Throughout their service, the battery suffered casualties, including 6 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, and 55 enlisted men who died of disease. Lieutenant george r. Was one of the commanders of the battery. \n\n<user> Can you please provide more details about their involvement in the battle of shiloh and the red river campaign? \n\n<assistant> Certainly. At the battle of shiloh, which took place on april 6-7, 1862, the 9th indiana battery light artillery was part of the union army gathered near pittsburg landing, tennessee. It was a fierce and bloody battle against confederate forces, and the union army ultimately emerged victorious. This battle was a significant early clash in the western theater of the civil war and helped to set the stage for future union offensives in the region.\n\nDuring the red river campaign, which took place from march 10 to may 22, 1864, the 9th indiana battery participated in several engagements. The goal of this campaign was for the union army to assert control over the red river in louisiana, essentially uprooting the confederate presence in the area. The battery took part in the capture of fort derussy on march 14 and the occupation of alexandria, louisiana, on march 16. They were also involved in the battle of pleasant hill on april 9 and the engagements at and around cloutiersville from april 22-24. The battery supported union forces during their retreat to morganza, louisiana, between may 13 and may 20, participating in fights at avoyelle's prairie and yellow bayou. Although the red river campaign was considered a failure overall for the union, the 9th indiana battery light artillery played a valuable role in several key engagements. \n\n<user> What happened to the battery after the battle of nashville? \n\n<assistant> After the battle of nashville, which took place on december 15-16, 1864, the 9th indiana battery light artillery participated in the pursuit of confederate general john bell hood's army to the tennessee river from december 17-28. This pursuit followed the union's victory at nashville, where they successfully defeated hood's forces.\n\nFollowing these events, the 9th indiana battery was ordered to indiana on january 25, 1865. Tragically, they faced disaster when the steamer eclypse, transporting the battery, blew up at johnsonville on january 27, 1865. Of the 70 officers and men on board, only 10 escaped unhurt. The veterans and recruits who survived were then assigned to duty at camp butler in springfield, illinois, where they remained until their discharge in june 1865.\n\nThroughout their service, the battery experienced significant casualties. A total of 61 men were lost - 6 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded in battle, and 55 enlisted men who succumbed to disease. The experiences and sacrifices of the 9th indiana battery light artillery remain an important part of the complex history of the american civil war. \n\n<user> What was the impact of this battery on the overall war? \n\n<assistant> The 9th indiana battery light artillery, like many other units in the civil war, played a crucial role in various campaigns and battles. While it is challenging to quantify their exact impact on the overall war, their contribution to multiple engagements, including the battle of shiloh, the red river campaign, and the battle of nashville, among others, demonstrates their significance in the union war effort.\n\nTheir service in these battles aided in the union's push to achieve strategic objectives, weaken confederate forces, and assert control over key regions. As part of artillery units, the 9th indiana battery provided essential fire support to infantry and cavalry operations, which was vital in achieving battlefield success. Their sacrifices and service are an integral piece of the larger tapestry of the american civil war, representing the fortitude and resilience of the union forces. ",

These territories included the region of the duchy of magdeburg, the brunswick-lüneburg territories of hanover and brunswick-wolfenbüttel, and the electorate of hesse. The kingdom's capital was cassel (modern spelling kassel). It was a member of the confederation of the rhine and was considered a napoleonic \"model state.\"\n\nDespite its short existence, the progressive reforms enacted in the kingdom of westphalia did have a lasting impact. The kingdom's modern-style constitution and the various freedoms introduced, such as equal rights for jews and liberated serfs, served as a model for reform in other german states. Even though most of its territories eventually became prussian in 1815, many of the reforms introduced in westphalia remained in place. \n\n<user> It's interesting to see the progressive nature of this short-lived kingdom. how did the financial situation of the kingdom of westphalia become so bad? and what role did napoleon play in the kingdom's economy during its existence? lastly, how were these financial issues connected to the eventual downfall of the kingdom? \n\n<assistant> The kingdom of westphalia experienced financial difficulties largely due to heavy taxes and payments demanded by napoleon. The first french empire saw the kingdom as a source of revenue and conscripted soldiers to supplement its own armed forces. Many of these conscripts never returned from the campaigns, such as the invasion of russia in 1812.\n\nThe kingdom's economy was already relatively poor, and these financial obligations further strained its resources. By 1812, the kingdom of westphalia was essentially bankrupt. As napoleon's power waned and he retreated in the face of advancing allied forces in 1813, the ill-fated kingdom was overrun by the allies. In 1815, most of the kingdom's territories were absorbed by prussia. The financial collapse of the kingdom played a significant role alongside the weakening of napoleon's influence in the eventual downfall of the kingdom of westphalia. \n\n<user> Could you provide specific examples of how the modern reforms enacted by the kingdom of westphalia impacted other german states and influenced their development? \n\n<assistant> Certainly, the progressive reforms enacted by the kingdom of westphalia significantly influenced other german states in their development. One notable example is the shift toward granting equal rights to jews. The kingdom enacted germany's first laws granting jews equal rights in 1808, and this laid the groundwork for the expansion of similar rights and emancipation in other german states, such as prussia, bavaria, and baden.\n\nAnother key reform was the liberation of serfs and the introduction of equal rights for all citizens. This also resonated with other german states, leading to the abolition of serfdom and the establishment of the concept of citizenship. The move to grant everyone the right to a jury trial exemplifies the progress toward equal rights under the law in westphalia, which later spread to other states.\n\nThe enactment of the kingdom's modern-style constitution also impacted the political landscape. As the first monarchy in germany to introduce such a constitution, the kingdom of westphalia influenced other states to consider administrative and constitutional reforms. Although the kingdom itself did not survive, the ideas generated during its existence persisted and contributed to the subsequent evolution of governance and the growth of the german federation.\n\nThe kingdom of westphalia, as a napoleonic model state, showcased the potential for progressive legal and social change. Despite its short existence and financial collapse, its innovative reforms left a lasting impression on the region and influenced the development of other german states. ",

        "reference": "The Kingdom of Westphalia was a kingdom in Germany, with a population of 2.6 million, that existed from 1807 to 1813. It included territory in Hesse and other parts of present-day Germany. While formally independent, it was a vassal state of the First French Empire and was ruled by Napoleon's brother Jérôme Bonaparte. It was named after Westphalia, but this was a misnomer since the kingdom had little territory in common with that area; rather the kingdom mostly covered territory formerly known as Eastphalia.\n\nNapoleon imposed the first written modern constitution in Germany, a French-style central administration, and agricultural reform. The Kingdom liberated the serfs and gave everyone equal rights and the right to a jury trial. In 1808 the Kingdom passed Germany's first laws granting Jews equal rights, thereby providing a model for reform in the other German states. Westphalia seemed to be progressive in immediately enacting and enforcing the new reforms.\n\nThe country was relatively poor but Napoleon demanded heavy taxes and payments and conscripted soldiers. Few of the men who marched into Russia with Napoleon in 1812 ever returned. The Kingdom was bankrupt by 1812. When Napoleon was retreating in the face of Allied advances in 1813, the Kingdom was overrun by the Allies and (in 1815) most of its territories became Prussian. Most of the reforms, however, remained in place.\n\nFormation\n\nThe Kingdom of Westphalia was created in 1807 by merging territories ceded by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Peace of Tilsit, among them the region of the Duchy of Magdeburg west of the Elbe River, the Brunswick-Lüneburg territories of Hanover and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and the Electorate of Hesse. Hesse's capital Cassel (modern spelling Kassel) then fulfilled the same function for Westphalia, and the king kept the court at the palace of Wilhelmshöhe, renamed Napoleonshöhe. The state was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine.\n\nSince it was intended as a Napoleonic \"model state\", a constitution was written and enacted by King Jérôme on 7 December 1807, the day after he had arrived in Cassel, making Westphalia the first monarchy in Germany with a modern-style constitution.",

This method uses low-temperature radio frequency energy during the surgery, causing less pain and faster healing than traditional heat-based methods.\n\nThe equipment for coblation tonsillectomy includes an rf generator, foot pedal control, irrigation system, and a special wand called the tonsil wand. The generator provides radio frequency energy, which travels through saline solution between the wand's active and base electrodes, forming charged ions. This creates a plasma field around the electrodes that is responsible for breaking down the tissue in a controlled way.\n\nThe plasma field has a small radius and is stable thanks to the continuous flow of saline solution. It is carefully controlled to prevent damage to healthy tissue around the tonsils. With no thermal effect on tissue, the temperature during coblation tonsillectomy is significantly lower than other methods, like electrosurgery, and helps minimize harm to the surrounding tissues.\n\nThere are several reasons for surgically removing tonsils using coblation tonsillectomy, including frequent tonsillitis, swollen or inflamed tonsils causing breathing problems, bleeding from the tonsils, and rare diseases or viruses affecting them. Like any medical surgery, risks associated with this procedure can include reactions to general anesthesia, swelling, and rare cases of bleeding. \n\n<user> Thank you for the explanation. differences between coblation tonsillectomy and traditional tonsillectomy methods, and why is coblation considered a better option? \n\n<assistant> Of course! The main difference between coblation tonsillectomy and traditional methods, such as electrocautery tonsillectomy, lies in the technology utilized and the level of pain and healing time for the patient. \n\nCoblation tonsillectomy uses low-temperature radio frequency energy to break down the molecular bonds in the targeted tissue, which creates a plasma field for removing soft tissues. This process generates temperatures of around 60°C to 70°C during the procedure, substantially lower than those produced in electrocautery tonsillectomy, which can reach 400°C to 600°C.\n\nDue to these lower temperatures, coblation tonsillectomy causes minimal thermal damage to tissues surrounding the targeted area, which results in less pain and a faster healing process for the patient. Electrocautery tonsillectomy, on the other hand, relies on heat generation and may cause more discomfort and longer healing times.\n\nSince its introduction in 2001, coblation tonsillectomy has been used in over 10 million operations, and research is still ongoing to determine its long-term effects. However, the benefits of reduced pain and faster healing make coblation tonsillectomy an attractive option compared to traditional heat-based methods. \n\n<user> Thanks for the clarification! i'm curious about tonsils' importance in our immune system, and how our bodies get by when they're removed after tonsillectomy? \n\n<assistant> Tonsils play a role in the body's immune system, particularly in children, as they create white blood cells to help fight diseases, bacteria, and viruses that enter through the mouth. They serve as a first line of defense against these invaders. However, their importance decreases as individuals grow older and are exposed to more bacteria and viruses, developing immunity to them.\n\nBy adulthood, the immune system function provided by tonsils becomes less critical, as the immune system has developed other ways of defending against infections. The body can still function effectively without tonsils, but their removal is not recommended unless medically warranted.\n\nTonsillectomies are often performed due to recurrent tonsillitis, enlarged tonsils causing breathing problems, or other medical conditions that negatively affect a patient's health. When tonsils are removed, the remaining parts of the immune system typically compensate for the absence of tonsils, and most people see little to no change in their overall immune response after the procedure.\n\nIt is important to note that tonsillectomy should only be performed for valid medical reasons to ensure the individual's health benefits from the surgery without the unnecessary exposure to the associated risks. \n\n<user> Are there any specific aftercare instructions for patients recovering from a coblation tonsillectomy? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are aftercare instructions to help ensure a smooth recovery after a coblation tonsillectomy. Some of these guidelines include:\n\n1. Pain management: patients may experience some pain and discomfort after the surgery. Doctors typically prescribe pain relief medication to help manage any discomfort during the healing process.\n\n2. Hydration: staying hydrated is crucial after the procedure, as it helps in healing and prevents dehydration. Patients should drink plenty of water and avoid drinks that might irritate the throat, such as acidic or carbonated beverages.\n\n3. Diet: initially, consuming soft, cold, or lukewarm foods can help ease any pain or discomfort during the recovery period. Examples include ice cream, gelatin, mashed potatoes, and applesauce. Gradually transitioning to solid foods is recommended as the patient’s comfort allows.\n\n4. Rest: adequate rest is essential to a speedy recovery. It is advised to avoid strenuous physical activities, such as sports or heavy lifting, for a couple of weeks after the surgery.\n\n5. Oral hygiene: maintaining good oral hygiene is important but should be done gently. Patients should avoid vigorous gargling or mouthwashing and instead try gentle rinsing with warm saltwater.\n\n6. Follow-up appointments: attending all follow-up appointments with your doctor is crucial to ensure proper healing and address any potential complications.\n\nIt is vital to follow the specific advice and instructions provided by the patient's healthcare team, as individual recommendations may vary depending on their circumstances and the surgical approach used. If any complications or concerns arise during the recovery process, patients should consult their healthcare provider immediately. ",

        "reference": "Coblation tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure in which the patient's tonsils are removed by destroying the surrounding tissues that attach them to the pharynx. It was first implemented in 2001. The word coblation is short for ‘controlled ablation’, which means a controlled procedure used to destroy soft tissue.\n\nThis procedure uses low temperature radio frequency during the operation, which was found to cause less pain for the patient than previous technologies used for tonsillectomy. Data collected from coblation tonsillectomy operations showed that the healing of the tonsillar fossa is much faster when this low temperature technology is used instead of a heat based technology, such as electrocautery tonsillectomy.\n\nSince coblation has been introduced to the medical field, more than 10 million surgical operations have been performed, but as of 2019, research is still ongoing to determine the positive and negative effects of this procedure.\n\nTechnology\n\nComponents \nThe equipment used for coblation tonsillectomy consists of a radio frequency (RF) generator, foot pedal control, irrigation system, and a tonsil wand. The generator provides radio frequency, which is essential for the procedure, and connects the foot pedal system to the tonsil wand. The foot pedals are colour coded to prevent confusion: one is yellow and is used for controlling the coblation, while the other is blue and used for controlling the radio frequency cautery. The wand is connected to the RF generator so it can be controlled with the pedals. The wand consists of a base electrode and an active electrode, which have ceramic and flowing saline between them. The radio frequency current that is produced by the generator travels through the saline, breaking the molecular bonds and forming ions. This creates a plasma field around the electrodes, which is used for removing soft tissue. There should not be any smoke produced while the coblation wand is being used during the operation; if this occurs, it is a sign that ablated tissue has entered the coblation wand's electrode area. This means that the current is not able to break down the saline into ions properly, so smoke is produced. When this happens, the coblation wand needs to be cleaned out before using it again.\n\nPlasma field \nThe plasma field has a radius of about 100μm-200μm around the electrodes and is kept stable within the head of the coblation wand by the continuous supply of saline. Furthermore, the plasma field is controlled by the bipolar energy between the negative and positive ions that are produced by the plasma in order to use a precise amount of plasma to prevent damaging healthy tissues around the tonsils.\n\nPlasma does not have a thermal effect on tissue: it only affects it on a chemical level. The plasma field produces positively charged hydrogen ions (H+) and negatively charged hydroxide ions (OH-), which enable plasma to destroy tissue. There is no or only minor damage done to nearby tissues during the coblation procedure because charged particles move between the generated plasma field and the ablated tissue, hence the molecules breakdown without the temperatures rising high.\n\nThe temperature for coblation tonsillectomy ranged from 60 °C to 70 °C, while other tonsillectomy operation procedures, such as electrosurgery require temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 600 °C, which is much higher. Thus, coblation is considered to be a non-heat focused medical procedure that is much better at causing minimal thermal damage to untargeted tissues near the targeted area.\n\nReasons for surgery \nThe need for removing tonsils of an individual using the coblation tonsillectomy surgical process can occur for four reasons. Firstly, the patient may have frequent long lasting tonsillitis. Secondly, tonsils can become swollen and inflamed which may cause breathing problems. Thirdly, blood loss can occur through the tonsils, which is a sign that they need to be removed. Lastly, in some cases tonsils get affected by rare diseases and viruses, which can only be treated by removing the tonsils.\n\nTonsillitis \nTonsils are part of the first line of defense in the mouth as they create white blood cells in order to fight diseases, bacteria and viruses that enter through the mouth. Owing to being exposed to amounts of material that enter the mouth, tonsils can become infected, which is called tonsillitis. This occurs mainly in children as in this age group is when the tonsils are the key providers of immune system functions. By the time individuals reach adulthood, they have been exposed to many diseases, bacteria and viruses, so they have developed immunity against these infection causing micro-organisms. Thus, adults normally do not need the help of tonsils anymore.\n\nWhen tonsillitis occurs regularly, meaning about seven times a year then the removal of tonsils is needed, otherwise it can have detrimental effects on the individual's health. Furthermore, tonsil surgery may be required when antibiotic treatment does not help in getting rid of the bacteria, which causes tonsillitis.\n\nSwollen tonsils \nAfter being exposed to several tonsil infections, tonsils have the tendency to become swollen and inflamed, but other factors may make them enlarged as well, such as genetics. Some of the significant problems that can arise due to having enlarged tonsils are breathing difficulties and the ability to swallow, thus the removal of tonsils is required.\n\nOther conditions \nAfter having frequent tonsil infections or severe diseases, bleeding from the tonsils tissues can occur. Furthermore, cancer cells can develop in the tonsil tissues. These are mostly uncommon but can still occur and can only be treated by surgically removing the tonsils from the both sides of the back of the throat.\n\nRisks of the surgery \nSimilarly to any other medical surgery, coblation tonsillectomy has health risk factors as well, which can but will not necessarily occur from the surgery. Firstly, reactions to the general anesthetic drug, which is used to make the patients sleep while they are under surgery, can cause both short-term and long-term health problems, for example minor health problems like vomiting, nausea, muscle soreness, headache, and major health problems can include death. Another risk factor is that swelling can occur throughout the whole mouth during the beginning section of the surgery, but swelling is most likely to occur on the tongue and in the tissues surrounding the tonsils at the back of the throat. Furthermore, rarely bleeding may be present in the tonsil area of the mouth throughout the surgical procedure, which would need extra treatment on top of the coblation tonsillectomy surgery. This would require the patient to remain in the hospital for a longer period of time in order to fully recover.",

Simon de montfort, a baronial rebel leader, initiated the gathering as a way to stabilize his political position and gather more support.\n\nHaving seized power in england after his victory over king henry iii at the battle of lewes during the second barons' war, montfort faced threats to his grip on the country. To consolidate his position, he summoned representatives from not only the barons and the knights of the shires, as seen in previous parliaments, but also from burgesses of the major towns. The parliament met in london and discussed radical reforms.\n\nWhile montfort was killed at the battle of evesham later that year, his idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments grew more popular under the reign of henry's son, edward i. By the 14th century, this became the norm, and the assembly eventually evolved into the house of commons. This parliament is sometimes considered the first english parliament, with montfort often referred to as the founder of the commons.\n\nThe background of this parliament goes back to 1258 when king henry iii of england faced a revolt among the english barons. Growing anger about the king's officials raising funds, the influence of his poitevin relatives at court, and his unpopular sicilian policy led to unrest even within the church. A coup d'état occurred on april 30th, leading to the king agreeing to govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen instead of personal rule.\n\nDespite efforts for reforms such as the provisions of oxford and the provisions of westminster, stability was not restored, and england's situation worsened. In 1263, civil war loomed, and montfort convened a council of rebel barons, leading to him seizing power.\n\nIn the midst of infighting among the barons and the fracturing of montfort's coalition, henry regained some freedom and eventually, civil war broke out in 1264. Montfort was desperate and followed henry's armies, culminating in the battle of lewes. Montfort emerged victorious, forcing henry to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the provisions of oxford.\n\nIt was under these circumstances that simon de montfort's parliament was held in january 1265, an assembly of diverse representatives and a precursor to the house of commons we know today. \n\n<user> How did the provisions of oxford and westminster affect the political situation in england? \n\n<assistant> The provisions of oxford and the provisions of westminster were two sets of legislative measures passed during the political crisis of the mid-13th century in england, aiming to reform governance and limit the abuse of power by the king and the major barons.\n\nThe provisions of oxford, established in 1258, created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons. This council had the power to appoint england's justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer and would be monitored through triennial parliaments. These provisions were intended to limit king henry iii's personal rule and restructure government operations by allowing more influence from the barons.\n\nAs for the provisions of westminster in 1259, they built upon the oxford provisions while introducing more radical measures. These measures tackled various grievances, such as land law reform, appointment of local officials, regulations on inheritance, and jewish money lending, among other issues.\n\nThough both sets of provisions aimed to create a more efficient and fair government, they contributed to further conflicts between various factions in england. Disagreements and the differing interests of barons like montfort, who sought even more radical reforms, resulted in instability and mounting tensions. The unstable political situation ultimately led to the second barons' war and the rise of simon de montfort as a major player in english politics. \n\n<user> What eventually led to the end of the second barons' war? \n\n<assistant> The second barons' war, a conflict between king henry iii and rebel english barons led by simon de montfort, eventually ended after a series of events that weakened and destabilized montfort's position.\n\nSimon de montfort's parliament in 1265 was meant to solidify his power and expand his base of support. Although it temporarily achieved this objective, montfort faced concurrent internal and external challenges that undermined his ability to maintain control.\n\nThe first challenge arose from internal divisions within montfort's coalition. His radical reform agenda alienated some barons who either supported moderate change or opposed any limitations on the king's power. Montfort failed to maintain the cohesiveness of his coalition, breeding dissent and laying the groundwork for his eventual downfall.\n\nExternally, montfort faced continued opposition from major figures, including henry's eldest son, prince edward (later king edward i). Edward managed to escape captivity after the battle of lewes and mobilized supporters against montfort. An important turning point occurred when gilbert de clare, the powerful earl of gloucester, a key supporter of montfort, defected to the royalist side. This defection undermined montfort's military strength and eroded his base of support.\n\nThe decisive event that marked the end of the second barons' war was the battle of evesham on august 4, 1265. Prince edward led the royalist forces against montfort's army in a battle characterized by a fierce and brutal fight. Montfort was significantly outnumbered, and his forces suffered a crushing defeat. Simon de montfort was killed during the battle, and his body was mutilated as a sign of disrespect.\n\nAfter evesham, the remaining rebel barons were gradually subdued by the royalist forces. The official conclusion of the war was the dictum of kenilworth in 1266, which was a royalist settlement offering pardons in exchange for fines. This settlement allowed the country to move past the conflict, and stability was gradually restored under henry iii and later his son, edward i.\n\nIn the aftermath, the montfortian vision of a more inclusive and representative parliament was largely overshadowed by the restoration of royal authority. It wasn't until the 14th century, under edward i's reign, that the idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliament became the norm, leading to the formation of the house of commons. \n\n<user> What was montfort's main occupation before rising to power? \n\n<assistant> Before rising to power, simon de montfort was mainly known as a nobleman and a military leader. He held the title of the earl of leicester, and he was an influential baron who played a crucial role in political events of the time, including the rebellion against king henry iii. ",

Anger had grown about the way the King 's officials were raising funds , the influence of his Poitevin relatives at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy ; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King . Within Henry 's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems . On 30 April , Hugh Bigod marched into Westminster in the middle of the King 's parliament , backed by his co @-@ conspirators , including Simon de Montfort , the Earl of Leicester , and carried out a coup d 'état . Henry , fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned , agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen , half chosen by the King and half by the barons . \n\n The pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a parliament met in June . The term \" parliament \" had first appeared in the 1230s and 1240s to describe large gatherings of the royal court , and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout Henry 's reign . They were used to agree upon the raising of taxes which , in the 13th century , were single , one @-@ off levies , typically on movable property , intended to support the King 's normal revenues for particular projects . During Henry 's reign , the counties had begun to send regular delegations to these parliaments , and came to represent a broader cross @-@ section of the community than simply the major barons . \n\n The new parliament passed a set of measures known as the Provisions of Oxford , which Henry swore to uphold . These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members , elected solely by the barons , which then had the power to appoint England 's justiciar , chancellor and treasurer , and which would be monitored through triennial parliaments . Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform , intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King 's officials and the major barons . More radical measures were passed by the new council the next year , in the form of the Provisions of Westminster . \n\n The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident . Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown ; others promoted only moderate change , while the conservative barons expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King 's powers . Over the next four years , neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England , and power swung back and forth between the different factions . By early 1263 , what remained of Henry 's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war . Montfort convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue his radical agenda and by October , England faced a likely civil war . Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt . Montfort took Henry and Queen Eleanor prisoner , and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry 's name , the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own , trusted men . \n\n Montfort 's coalition began to quickly fragment , Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England . Henry appealed to his brother @-@ in @-@ law Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute ; Montfort was initially hostile to this idea , but , as war became more likely again , he decided to agree to French arbitration as well . Initially Montfort 's legal arguments held sway , but in January 1264 , Louis announced the Mise of Amiens , condemning the rebels , upholding the King 's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford . The Second Barons ' War finally broke out in April , when Henry led an army into Montfort 's territories . Becoming desperate , Montfort marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May . Despite their numerical superiority , Henry 's forces were overwhelmed .

        "reference": "The University of Toronto Campus Safety Division, formerly named the University of Toronto Campus Police, was created in 1904 as the university's campus police force. The University of Toronto Campus Safety division has jurisdiction over 80,000 students, faculty and staff, in addition to the thousands of visitors to the University each day.\n\nThe division is commanded by three Police (Special Constable) managers assigned to each campus (St. George, Scarborough and Mississauga-Erindale). Several platoons have been organized which consist of Staff Sergeants, Corporals and Constables. These platoons of officers provide policing services to the University around the clock, 365 days per year. Each platoon consists of specialized officers who are trained in general and advanced patrol functions. In addition, officers are also trained in advanced criminal investigation functions, including SOCO (scene of crime officer). Campus Safety SOCO officers will examine crime scenes for trace evidence and submit their findings to Toronto Police Forensic Identification Unit.\n\nUniversity of Toronto Campus Safety Special Constables are sworn in as Peace Officers through the Toronto Police and Peel Police Services Boards after being approved by the Provincial Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services. Special Constables are appointed as Peace Officers under the Ontario Police Services Act. This appointment under the Act confers police authority on Campus Safety officers as per the agreement with Toronto and Peel Regional Police Services Boards. Campus Safety officers possess powers of arrest, search and seizure. They also have the authority and discretion to lay criminal and provincial offence charges. Offenders who are taken into custody by University of Toronto Campus Police are transported to city/regional police detention centers for holding and processing. Campus Safety provides policing services specific to the university sector, which otherwise may not be provided by the jurisdictional police. Criminal/provincial offence occurrences which occur within the University community are investigated by Campus Safety, who prepare jurisdictional police reports which are then submitted to Toronto or Peel Police as per the Special Constable Service agreement.\n\nIn 2019, the Government of Ontario passed the Comprehensive Police Services Act (Bill 68) which revoked Special Constable services' rights to call themselves \"police\" services. Under the new law, only municipal and provincial law enforcement agencies authorized by the Solicitor General of Ontario may call themselves \"Police\" departments. Accordingly, the University of Toronto Campus Police rebranded itself as \"Campus Safety\" and re-outfitted all its liveries and visual media. The rebranding was completed in 2021.\n\nJurisdiction\n\nThe U of T Campus Safety Division has Peace Officer authority for all areas of the University of Toronto campus as well as roads abutting the property. Furthermore, they have police authority away from the University as long as the original offence occurred on or in relation to the University of Toronto, within the City of Toronto or Region of Peel.\n\nResponsibility\nThe Campus Safety division enforces the following statutes:\n\nCriminal Code of Canada\nControlled Drugs and Substances Act\nTrespass to Property Act of Ontario\nLiquor Licence Act of Ontario\nSection 17 of the Mental Health Act of Ontario\nSelected municipal by-laws\n\nIn addition, Campus Safety enforce parts of the University of Toronto Student Code of Conduct.\n\nCampus Safety patrol in marked vehicles which are designed to be easily identifiable to the public. Officers also patrol on foot and on mountain bikes.\n\nCommunity Response Unit (CRU)\n\nIn addition to the uniform presence/primary response that the Campus Safety provide, the CRU  works behind the scenes on an array of projects which include but are not limited to:\n\n Case Management (Criminal and Provincial offences)\n Property and Evidence Management\n VIP visits / Special Events\n Crime Prevention / CPTED auditing (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design)\n Intelligence, Investigations & Follow up\n\nSeveral officers with the University of Toronto Campus Safety are SOCOs (Scene of Crime Officers) who are designated to process crime scenes and collect evidence. Evidence that the Campus Police may collect is then forwarded to the Toronto Police Forensic Identification Services for further investigation and evaluation.",

He played college football at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nEarly years\nAllegre began playing football in 1977, while attending Shelton High School as an exchange student. Originally a soccer player, he had never played American football before his senior season at Shelton. Head Coach Jack Stark asked him to try kicking footballs one day before the season began. He had great distance, but each ball went below the crossbar. Coach Stark asked him if he could kick it above the crossbar and Allegre remarked that he could, but thought it was like a soccer goal and was aiming below.\n\nHe was named the starter at placekicker to handle field goals, extra points and kickoffs. The team only won 3 games during the season and Allegre only had a chance to kick 3 field goal attempts and 9 extra point attempts, although he regularly kicked off with great distance.\n\nCollege career\nBecause he did not get much exposure, Stark filmed him kicking from long distance and sent the tape to different colleges. He received interest from the University of Montana, who initially offered a partial football scholarship, that did not include expenses for lodging, books and meals. Allegre declined the offer and the school countered with a full scholarship, although it didn't have an engineering program as he wanted.\n\nAfter two years, he opted to transfer to the University of Texas at Austin because of its reputation in engineering.\n\nIn 1980, Allegre walked on to the football team and was redshirted because of the NCAA transfer rules. During that time, he handled the scout team kicking duties. In the fall semester he was given a full football scholarship.\n\nIn 1981, he was named the starting placekicker. He finished his last 2 seasons with 27 out of 45 field goals (.600), 66 out of 68 extra points (.970) and 147 total points. He earned an undergraduate degree with honors in civil engineering.\n\nProfessional career\nAllegre was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1983 NFL Draft, where he had to go through a try out session. On August 23, he was traded to the Baltimore Colts, in exchange for a ninth round draft choice (#232-John Hunt).\n\nAs a rookie, he made 30 field goals (franchise record) out of 35 attempts and 22 out of 24 extra points, for an 85.7% average (franchise record) and a total of 112 points (franchise record). He tied a franchise record by making 5 field goals against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 1984, he missed 3 preseason games with a bruised heel. He injured a hamstring in the season opener and missed the next 4 contests, only appearing in 12 games. Dean Biasucci replaced him from the second to the sixth game and would remain as a kickoff specialist for the rest of the season. Allegre did not make a field goal until the eighth game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He connected on 11-for-18 field goal attempts (61.1%) and had a perfect 14-for-14 on extra point attempts. \n\nIn 1985, he made 16-of 26 field goal attempts, for a low 61.5% average and was 36-of-39 on extra points. On September 4, 1986, he was waived by the then Indianapolis Colts, after Biasucci passed him on the depth chart.\n\nIn 1986, after New York Giants' kicker Ali Haji-Sheikh was injured, the team began auditions to find a replacement. Allegre's two-week tryout was successful, kicking a 57-yard field goal that convinced Coach Bill Parcells to sign him. Because Allegre decided to call his agent before signing the contract, Parcells decided to cancel the deal, signing instead Joe Cooper. After three ineffective performances by Cooper, Parcells called Allegre back and signed him on September 25, becoming the team's sixth kicker in 19 games.",

Can you please provide information on what it was, its purpose, and what materials it offered? \n\n<assistant> The UCLA Language Materials Project (LMP) was a web resource focused on teaching materials for approximately 150 languages that are less commonly taught in the United States. Established in 1992 and funded by the U.S. Department of Education, the project was part of the UCLA Center for World Languages, but funding was terminated in 2014, leading to the deactivation of the LMP website.\n\nThe LMP provided a bibliographic database featuring over 7000 items, such as textbooks, readers, phrasebooks, grammars, dictionaries, and supplementary materials in various formats like print, audio, video, and web-based instruction. It helped users find the most suitable tools for their teaching and learning needs through detailed descriptions of the content and other features.\n\nAdditionally, the website offered a database and guide for authentic materials like native-language posters, signs, and advertisements, which are valuable for teaching as they reflect current culture and actual language usage. Each language's profile showcased its linguistic history, key dialects, and sociolinguistic information. Materials reports were generated for publishers and policymakers to assess the availability of teaching materials for specific languages.\n\nThe LMP also linked to external databases like CARLA, which contained information on courses offered in different institutions across the U.S. And Canada, and the CAL database, another platform for teaching materials in underrepresented languages. Lastly, the project provided resources for K-12 language teachers, including lesson plans, curricular frameworks, and links to valuable external resources. \n\n<user> What happened to all that information when funding ended? \n\n<assistant> When funding was terminated in 2014, the Language Materials Project website was deactivated, which meant the direct access to those resources and databases became unavailable. The termination led to limited availability of those valuable resources for language teachers and students focused on less commonly taught languages.\n\nHowever, it is possible that some of the resources or databases might have been preserved by other organizations or individuals who are dedicated to language education. Some institutions or collaborators associated with the project might still have access to certain materials. It's also worth considering that newer initiatives could have been developed in its place, providing alternative resources for language education in less commonly taught languages. Searching for those alternatives or reaching out to organizations focused on language education could yield potential resources in a similar vein to the LMP. \n\n<user> Given that the lmp is now inactive, what are some other resources or organizations that language teachers and learners can use to find materials and support for less commonly taught languages? \n\n<assistant> Although the ucla language materials project is no longer functional, there are several other organizations and resources that can help language teachers and learners find materials and support for less commonly taught languages:\n\n1. Center for advanced research on language acquisition (carla): located at the university of minnesota, carla provides resources and conducts research on language teaching and learning.\n\n2. Center for applied linguistics (cal): cal is dedicated to promoting language learning and understanding. They offer research findings and instructional materials related to language education.\n\n3. American council on the teaching of foreign languages (actfl): actfl promotes language education and provides resources, including teaching materials, assessment tools, and professional development opportunities for language teachers.\n\n4. National foreign language resource centers (nflrc): funded by the u.s. Department of education, these centers develop resources and conduct research specifically aimed at improving language education.\n\n5. Lingualinks library: a digital collection of resources related to various aspects of linguistics, including language assessment, language learning, and language teaching materials.\n\n6. Omniglot: a website providing comprehensive information on various languages, including writing systems, pronunciation guides, translation tools, and language learning resources.\n\n7. Yojik.eu: yojik hosts a collection of open-source language courses and materials developed by the u.s. Government, which can be useful for learning less commonly taught languages.\n\n8. Language-specific organizations and associations: many languages have dedicated organizations, websites, or online forums focused on language learning and teaching, providing resources and support.\n\nIt is crucial to explore and network with various organizations and resources to find materials and support tailored to your specific language teaching or learning needs. \n\n<user> How can language teachers adapt their teaching techniques and materials to engage students in less commonly taught languages, considering the limited resources available? \n\n<assistant> Adapting teaching techniques and materials for less commonly taught languages can indeed be challenging due to limited resources. However, language teachers can consider the following strategies to engage students:\n\n1. Authentic materials: utilize materials intended for native speakers, such as newspapers, magazines, advertisements, radio shows, podcasts, videos, or websites. These resources usually provide genuine language use and cultural context and can be adapted to create engaging activities.\n\n2. Task-based language teaching: encourage students to perform tasks that require them to use the target language, like role-plays, simulations, or project-based activities. This promotes language use in real-life contexts, improving engagement and learning outcomes.\n\n3. Collaborative learning: create activities that encourage peer collaboration, such as group discussions, debates, or presentations. This allows students to learn from one another, practice communication skills, and generate motivation.\n\n4. Technology integration: incorporate multimedia and online resources into your lessons. Language learning apps, videos, and interactive websites can provide students with more exposure to less commonly taught languages, fostering engagement.\n\n5.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I've been experiencing muscle weakness and skin rashes lately. can you provide more information about these symptoms and what condition they might be associated with? \n\n<assistant> Your symptoms could be indicative of a condition called dermatomyositis (dm). This is a long-term inflammatory disorder that affects skin and muscles. The main symptoms include a skin rash and worsening muscle weakness over time, which may occur suddenly or develop over months. The skin rash could be purplish, red, or lilac and appear around the eyes, on the upper chest or back, and other areas like the upper arms, thighs, or hands. Gottron's sign, which involves red or violet papules, may also be present on finger joints or other bony prominences.\n\nOther possible symptoms of dm include weight loss, fever, lung inflammation, or light sensitivity. Complications might involve calcium deposits in muscles or skin. Although the exact cause is unknown, theories suggest it could be an autoimmune disease or the result of a viral infection. Dermatomyositis might also develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome related to various cancers. To diagnose this condition, a combination of symptoms, blood tests, electromyography, and muscle biopsies are typically used.\n\nIf you are concerned about these symptoms, it is important to consult a healthcare professional to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatments usually improve symptoms and can consist of medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics and assistive devices, and rest. \n\n<user> What treatments are commonly prescribed? \n\n<assistant> For dermatomyositis, the treatment plan usually involves medications, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics, and rest to help manage symptoms and improve the condition. The most common medications prescribed for dm are corticosteroids, which help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. If steroids are not working well, other agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be recommended. Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) may help improve the outcomes for some patients.\n\nThe physical therapy goals typically include increasing muscle strength, maintaining flexibility, and improving overall function. Therapeutic exercises are designed to address the specific muscle groups affected by this condition. Heat therapy can help relieve muscle pain and stiffness, and orthotics or assistive devices, like canes, walkers, or braces, can be utilized for better support and mobility. Adequate rest is also crucial as it allows the body to recover from the inflammation.\n\nIt is essential to work with a healthcare professional to develop a personalized treatment plan based on individual needs and specific symptoms. \n\n<user> Are certain people at a higher risk for developing dermatomyositis? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are certain factors that may increase an individual's risk of developing dermatomyositis. The condition usually affects people in their 40s and 50s. Interestingly, women are more likely to be affected than men. However, people of any age may develop dm, including children and the elderly.\n\nCertain cases of the condition may also be linked with an individual's genetic makeup. Hla subtypes, such as hla-dr3, hla-dr52, and hla-dr6, have been associated with a predisposition to autoimmune dermatomyositis. Another known risk factor is its association with malignancy. This condition can develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome in relation to various forms of cancer, including ovarian, breast, and lung cancers. The risk of developing malignancy in association with dermatomyositis increases after age 60.\n\nIt is essential to be aware of these risk factors and to consult with a healthcare professional if you experience any persistent symptoms associated with dm. \n\n<user> How can i manage to live a normal life while dealing with dermatomyositis? \n\n<assistant> Living with dermatomyositis can be challenging, but there are ways to manage the condition and maintain a good quality of life. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Collaboration with healthcare professionals: work closely with your doctors, therapists, and specialists to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and helps control symptoms.\n\n2. Medication adherence: follow your prescribed medication schedule and always consult your doctor before making any changes.\n\n3. Exercise and physical therapy: regularly participate in physical therapy and appropriate exercise routines, as these can help maintain muscle strength, flexibility, and overall function.\n\n4. Heat therapy: consider using heat therapy to alleviate muscle pain and stiffness.\n\n5. Assistive devices: utilize orthotics and assistive devices that can improve mobility and provide support, like canes, walkers, or braces.\n\n6. Rest: ensure that you get adequate rest, as it allows your body to recover from inflammation.\n\n7. Emotional support: seek support from family, friends, or support groups, as dealing with a chronic condition can be emotionally challenging.\n\n8. Sun protection: since sunlight may exacerbate rashes in some dm cases, take precautions like wearing sun-protective clothing, using sunscreen, and avoiding unnecessary sun exposure.\n\n9. Monitor for potential complications: keep track of any changes in symptoms, and report them to your healthcare provider.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and maintaining open communication with your healthcare team, you can manage dermatomyositis' impact on your daily life and maintain a good quality of life.

        "current_turn": "<user> What treatments are commonly prescribed? \n\n<assistant> For dermatomyositis, the treatment plan usually involves medications, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics, and rest to help manage symptoms and improve the condition. The most common medications prescribed for dm are corticosteroids, which help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. If steroids are not working well, other agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be recommended. Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) may help improve the outcomes for some patients.\n\nThe physical therapy goals typically include increasing muscle strength, maintaining flexibility, and improving overall function. Therapeutic exercises are designed to address the specific muscle groups affected by this condition. Heat therapy can help relieve muscle pain and stiffness, and orthotics or assistive devices, like canes, walkers, or braces, can be utilized for better support and mobility. Adequate rest is also crucial as it allows the body to recover from the inflammation.\n\nIt is essential to work with a healthcare professional to develop a personalized treatment plan based on individual needs and specific symptoms.",

        "reference": "Dermatomyositis (DM) is a long-term inflammatory disorder which affects skin and the muscles. Its symptoms are generally a skin rash and worsening muscle weakness over time. These may occur suddenly or develop over months. Other symptoms may include weight loss, fever, lung inflammation, or light sensitivity. Complications may include calcium deposits in muscles or skin.\n\nThe cause is unknown. Theories include that it is an autoimmune disease or a result of a viral infection. Dermatomyositis may develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with several forms of malignancy. It is a type of inflammatory myopathy. Diagnosis is typically based on some combination of symptoms, blood tests, electromyography, and muscle biopsies.\n\nWhile no cure for the condition is known, treatments generally improve symptoms. Treatments may include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics and assistive devices, and rest. Medications in the corticosteroids family are typically used with other agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine recommended if steroids are not working well. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also improve outcomes. Most people improve with treatment and in some, the condition resolves completely.\n\nAbout one per 100,000 people per year are newly affected. The condition usually occurs in those in their 40s and 50s with women being affected more often than men. People of any age, however, may be affected. The condition was first described in the 1800s.\n\nSigns and symptoms \nThe main symptoms include several kinds of skin rash along with muscle weakness in both upper arms or thighs.\n\nSkin \nOne form the rashes take is called \"heliotrope\" (a purplish color) or lilac, but may also be red. It can occur around the eyes along with swelling, but also occurs on the upper chest or back what is called the \"shawl\" (around the neck) or \"V-sign\" above the breasts and may also occur on the face, upper arms, thighs, or hands.  Another form the rash takes is called Gottron's sign which are red or violet, sometimes scaly, slightly raised papules that erupt on any of the finger joints (the metacarpophalangeal joints or the interphalangeal joints). Gottron's papules may also be found over other bony prominences including the elbows, knees, or feet. All these rashes are made worse by exposure to sunlight, and are often very itchy, painful, and may bleed.\n\nIf a person exhibits only skin findings characteristic of DM, without weakness or abnormal muscle enzymes, then he or she may be experiencing amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM), formerly known as \"dermatomyositis sine myositis\".\n\nMuscles \nPeople with DM experience progressively worsening muscle weakness in the proximal muscles (for example, the shoulders and thighs). Tasks that use these muscles: standing from sitting, lifting, and climbing stairs, can become increasingly difficult for people with dermatomyositis.\n\nOther \nAround 30% of people have swollen, painful joints, but this is generally mild.\n\nIn some people, the condition affects the lungs, and they may have a cough or difficulty breathing.  If the condition affects the heart,  arrhythmias may occur. If it affects the blood vessels in the stomach or intestines, which is more common in juvenile DM, the people might vomit blood, have black tarry bowel movements, or may develop a hole somewhere in their GI tract.\n\nCauses \n\nThe cause is unknown, but it may result from an initial viral infection or cancer, either of which could raise an autoimmune response.\n\nBetween 7 and 30% of dermatomyositis arise from cancer, probably as an autoimmune response. The most commonly associated cancers are ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer.  18 to 25% of people with amyopathic DM also have cancer. Malignancy in association with dermatomyositis is more prevalent after age 60.\n\nSome cases are inherited, and HLA subtypes HLA-DR3, HLA-DR52, and HLA-DR6 seem to create a disposition to autoimmune dermatomyositis.",

It was initially known as the midtown greenway pedestrian bridge. The bridge was renamed in honor of martin olav sabo, a 14-term member of congress from minnesota, to acknowledge his contributions to the project and the city. Sabo secured $2.9 million in federal funding for the project, which ultimately cost $5.1 million, with additional funding coming from hennepin county.\n\nOpened in november 2007, the bridge plays a crucial role in the city's transportation system. It connects phase 2 and phase 3 of the minneapolis midtown greenway at hiawatha avenue, enabling continuous biking across the city. Besides, it links longfellow community (longfellow and seward neighborhoods) to phillips community (east phillips neighborhood) and connects users to the hiawatha lrt trail and little earth trail. The bridge eliminates the need for cyclists and pedestrians to cross busy hiawatha avenue at grade-level, enhancing safety and convenience. \n\n<user> Could you describe the structure and configuration of the bridge, such as its length, height, and how it helps bicyclists and pedestrians? \n\n<assistant> The martin olav sabo bridge has a total length of 2,200 feet, and its main span is 220 feet over hiawatha avenue. The cable-stay tower of the bridge rises 100 feet above the bridge-deck level. It holds the distinction of being the first true cable-stayed suspension bridge in the state of minnesota. The design, which came from engineering consulting firm urs with community input, offers an efficient and safe route for pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\nThe configuration of the bridge has been designed to improve safety and convenience for its users. Previously, bicyclists and pedestrians had to cross hiawatha avenue using a grade-level stoplight, which posed risks due to heavy traffic. The sabo bridge eliminates this issue by bringing users north one block, taking them over the highway, and then bringing them back south, introducing a new grade-level crossing at 28th street east, just west of hiawatha. This design significantly reduces the number of interactions between users and traffic, ensuring a safer crossing experience.\n\nDespite the existence of the bridge, users can still choose to use the at-grade hiawatha crossing if they wish. The bridge not only enhances connectivity between neighborhoods and trails but also promotes a safer and more enjoyable biking and walking experience for minneapolis residents and visitors. \n\n<user> In 2012, there were structural failures that caused the bridge to be closed several times. what were the causes of the issues, and what steps were taken to address them? \n\n<assistant> The martin olav sabo bridge experienced structural failures in 2012 that led to several closures. On february 19, 2012, two of the bridge's longest support cables were found to be detached and lying across the bridge deck below. As a result, the bridge was closed to all traffic, including the portions of hiawatha avenue that pass underneath, and the light rail service was suspended on tracks beneath the bridge.\n\nThe initial cable failure resulted from cracks in diaphragm plates that anchor the ends of the cables to the steel tower. Upon further inspection, significant cracks were found in three of those anchorages. Engineering firm wiss, janney, elstner associates, inc. Was hired to investigate the cause of the plate compromise. A summary report of the failure analysis released on june 8, 2012, identified that unaccounted wind-induced cable vibrations led to the failures of the attachment points.\n\nEmergency supports were placed underneath the bridge, and a second pair of cables were removed due to cracks in their anchor points. The light rail service resumed on february 24, 2012, and hiawatha avenue was reopened to traffic beneath the bridge on february 27, 2012. The bridge, supported by temporary bracing, was reopened on june 1, 2012. However, it was closed again for repairs on september 23, 2012, before finally reopening on november 19, 2012, after the completion of necessary repairs.\n\nThese incidents highlighted the need for enhanced structural analysis and monitoring to ensure the safety of such infrastructure projects, ultimately leading to improvements in bridge design, construction, and maintenance practices.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> History of the clifton suspension bridge. \n\n<assistant> The Clifton Suspension Bridge is an iconic engineering marvel that spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon, connecting Clifton in Bristol to Leigh Woods in North Somerset. The idea of constructing a bridge across the Avon Gorge dates back to 1753. Initially, plans were made for a stone bridge, but later proposals involved a wrought iron structure.\n\nIn 1831, an attempt to build a bridge based on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's design was halted due to the Bristol riots. A revised version of Brunel's design, which also involved the contributions of William Henry Barlow, John Hawkshaw, and Sarah Guppy, was eventually constructed after Brunel's death and completed in 1864.\n\nAn interesting feature of the bridge is that its towers are not identical in design. The Clifton tower has side cut-outs, while the Leigh tower features more pointed arches atop a 110-foot (34 m) red sandstone-clad abutment. The bridge's unique design also includes roller-mounted \"saddles\" at the top of each tower that allow the movement of three independent wrought iron chains on each side when loads pass over the bridge.\n\nInitially, the Clifton Bridge Company managed the bridge under a license from a charitable trust. However, the trust eventually purchased the company shares and took over the bridge's running in 1949, utilizing toll income for maintenance.\n\nToday, the Clifton Suspension Bridge is not only a grade I listed building but also a distinctive landmark that symbolizes Bristol on postcards, promotional materials, and informational websites. It has even been featured in films, television advertising, and various cultural events. \n\n<user> What cultural events have taken place at the bridge? \n\n<assistant> The clifton suspension bridge has been the venue for numerous remarkable cultural events over the years. Some notable events include:\n\n1. The first modern bungee jump: in 1979, the clifton suspension bridge witnessed the birth of modern bungee jumping when the oxford university dangerous sports club performed the first jump from the bridge using elastic ropes.\n\n2. The last concorde flight: in 2003, the bridge served as a backdrop for the final flight of concorde, the iconic supersonic passenger aircraft. The aircraft flew over the clifton suspension bridge on its way to its final resting place at filton airfield near bristol.\n\n3. Olympic torch relay handover: in 2012, as part of the celebrations leading up to the london olympics, the clifton suspension bridge played host to a handover of the olympic torch. The torch relay was an essential event symbolizing the unification of people and the spirit of the olympic games.\n\nThese significant events, among others, have helped to solidify the iconic status of the clifton suspension bridge as a symbol of bristol's rich cultural history and engineering heritage. The bridge continues to captivate both locals and visitors with its stunning architecture and breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape, making it an essential part of bristol's identity. \n\n<user> What was the bristol bridge riot of 1793? \n\n<assistant> The bristol bridge riot of 1793 was a violent protest that erupted in response to the tolls imposed for crossing the newly constructed bristol bridge. To give some context, the original bristol bridge, a stone bridge built in the 13th century, had houses with shopfronts built on it as a way to fund its maintenance. However, by the early 18th century, the increase in traffic and the encroachment of shops on the roadway made the bridge perilous for pedestrians.\n\nA new bridge was designed by james bridges and finished by thomas paty between 1763 and 1768 to replace the old bristol bridge. Unfortunately, the practice of levying tolls to use the new bridge angered many locals, leading to the bristol bridge riot in 1793.\n\nRiots broke out as people protested against the tolls, demanding free passage across the bridge. The unrest escalated, resulting in the destruction of property, clashes with the authorities, and even the loss of lives. The military was called in to suppress the riots, which caused further casualties.\n\nThe bristol bridge riot of 1793 was a significant event in the city's history, highlighting the social tensions and the importance of the bridge in the daily lives of bristol's population. In the aftermath, it became apparent that future bridge construction and management had to account for the needs and opinions of the local populace, which was taken into consideration when planning the clifton suspension bridge. Today, the history of the bristol bridge riot serves as a reminder of the importance of balancing infrastructure development and the expectations of the communities it serves. ",

In 2004, interbrew and ambev merged to create inbev, the world's largest brewer at that time. This merger combined top brands from belgium, canada, germany, and brazil.\n\nIn 2008, inbev acquired american brewer anheuser-busch for $52 billion, forming anheuser-busch inbev. This expanded inbev's position as the world's largest brewer and created one of the top five consumer products companies. Over the years, ab inbev has continued to grow through various acquisitions, such as harbin brewery (2004), fujian sedrin brewery (2006), and energy drink company hiball (2017). In 2016, ab inbev merged with south african competitor sabmiller, further strengthening its position as the world's largest brewer. \n\n<user> Ab inbev's partnership with a cannabis producer and their affiliation with the international alliance for responsible drinking? \n\n<assistant> In december 2018, ab inbev formed a partnership with cannabis producer tilray, aiming to research cannabis-infused non-alcoholic beverages. They planned to work together on this research through tilray's subsidiary, high park company. This partnership is focused on exploring the potential for non-alcoholic beverages containing thc, cbd, or a combination of both, in response to the growing interest in cannabis-related products.\n\nAnheuser-busch inbev also takes part in responsible consumption initiatives. In 2013, it joined other alcohol producers in signing the international alliance for responsible drinking's producers' commitments. These commitments are a part of an initiative aimed at reducing harmful drinking by promoting responsible consumption practices and cooperating with various stakeholders to address alcohol-related issues. By participating in this initiative, ab inbev demonstrates its commitment to social responsibility and promoting a healthier and safer environment for consumers. \n\n<user> How did ambev become such a big company in latin america and the caribbean? \n\n<assistant> Ambev, or companhia de bebidas das américas, became a major player in the latin america and the caribbean region through a strategic merger and its strong brands. In 1999, the two biggest brazilian brewing companies, antarctica (established in 1880) and brahma (established in 1886), decided to merge, creating ambev. This combination of resources and expertise allowed the new company to have a dominant position in latin america and the caribbean. \n\nAmbev grew and expanded further by focusing on popular beverage brands and establishing a leading presence in the market. Their products appealed to a wide range of consumers, both within brazil and in neighboring countries. Ambev's success eventually led them to merge with interbrew in 2004, forming inbev, the world's largest brewer at that time. This merger amplified their global footprint and further reinforced their presence in the latin american and caribbean markets. \n\n<user> What happened to SABMiller after the merger with AB InBev? \n\n<assistant> After the successful merger with ab inbev in october 2016, sabmiller ceased trading on global stock markets. To avoid potential antitrust issues and regulatory concerns, ab inbev had to divest some of sabmiller's assets.\n\nAs a result, the company sold the former sabmiller's interest in millercoors to molson coors. They also sold many of sabmiller's european brands to the japanese beverage corporation asahi breweries. Furthermore, ab inbev sold a significant portion of sabmiller's coca-cola bottling and distribution interests to the american beverage group, coca-cola company.\n\nThese divestitures not only helped streamline the merged company's operations but also ensured regulatory approval for the merger by addressing concerns about its potential impact on the industry's competitive landscape.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> What exactly is a variable gauge system and how it works? how do trains with different track gauges manage to travel across breaks in gauges without stopping? \n\n<assistant> A variable gauge system enables railway vehicles in a train to travel across a break of gauge caused by two railway networks with differing track gauges. It eliminates the need for dual gauge tracks or transshipment, providing a smoother and faster transition between networks.\n\nFor a train to operate through different gauges, it must be equipped with special bogies holding variable gauge wheelsets. These wheelsets contain a variable gauge axle (vga). As the train passes through a gauge changer or gauge changing facility, the track widens or narrows to adjust the train's gauge. The wheels are unlocked, moved closer together or further apart, and then re-locked to match the next track's gauge.\n\nSeveral variable gauge axle systems are in use around the world, like talgo-rd, caf-brava, db cargo–knorr-bremse, dbag–rafil type v, japan railways rtri, and pkp suw 2000. However, not every system is compatible with each other.\n\nA gauge changer is the device that enables gauge adjustment in the wheels. It features a pair of running rails that gradually vary in width between the two gauges, in addition to other rails and levers to unlock, move, and re-lock the adjustable axles. \n\nThe variable gauge system is particularly important in international railway traffic because gauge changes tend to happen more frequently at international borders. This technology has been implemented on several international links such as spain/france, sweden/finland, poland/lithuania, and poland/ukraine.\n\nThough some limitations exist, such as those regarding suitability for motive power or requiring unloading before gauge changing, variable gauge systems overall offer a fast, efficient solution to the challenge of different track gauges. \n\n<user> Can you describe the compatibility and interoperability between these different variable gauge axle systems? also, i read about a unichanger in development that can handle multiple vga systems. how does that work, and what is its progress? \n\n<assistant> The compatibility and interoperability between different variable gauge axle systems vary. For instance, only the suw 2000 and rafil type v systems are interoperable, while the talgo-rd and caf-brava systems are also compatible with each other. Different systems may not work together seamlessly, which can pose challenges in international railway traffic.\n\nIn 2009, a unichanger was under development near tarragona, in roda de barà. This unique gauge changer is designed to handle four different vga systems simultaneously, providing increased flexibility and compatibility across various networks. By catering to multiple vga systems, the unichanger can significantly enhance international rail traffic by simplifying the gauge-changing process for trains.\n\nHowever, the current development status or progress of the unichanger is not mentioned in the provided information. \n\n<user> You mentioned some variable gauge systems have limitations, such as being unsuitable for motive power, requiring unloading before gauge changing, or applicable only to certain types of rolling stock. could you explain these limitations in more detail and provide examples of specific systems where these limitations apply? \n\n<assistant> Certainly. Different variable gauge systems come with their own limitations, which affect their usability and application for certain types of railway vehicles or conditions.\n\n1. Unsuitable for motive power: some systems might not be well-suited for locomotives or other types of motive power, especially ones designed for passenger traffic. An example of this limitation is the variable gauge used in spain, where trains primarily run on a mix of dedicated high-speed lines and older iberian gauge lines.\n\n2. Unloading requirement: certain systems might need rolling stock (like freight or passenger cars) to be unloaded prior to undergoing the gauge-changing process. This limitation can affect cargo transportation when using variable gauge systems; however, the provided information does not specify any particular vga system.\n\n3. Rolling stock limitations: some variable gauge axles might be designed only for carriages and wagons, and thus wouldn’t be applicable to locomotives or other rolling stock types. One such example is the db cargo–knorr-bremse system. \n\n<user> What countries currently use variable gauge systems for their train network? \n\n<assistant> Several countries have implemented variable gauge systems to facilitate train operations across different track gauges. Here is a list of some countries using variable gauge systems and the associated international links:\n\n1. Spain: variable gauge systems are prevalent in spain, especially for passenger traffic. Trains using this technology operate on a mix of high-speed lines (using standard gauge) and older lines (using iberian gauge). Spain has also implemented this system on the international link between spain and france.\n\n2. France: as mentioned, the country has cooperated with spain to establish a variable gauge system on their international link, allowing for better connectivity between the two railway networks.\n\n3. Sweden: variable gauge systems are used on the international link between sweden and finland with swedish trains, simplifying cross-border train operations.\n\n4. Finland: the international link between sweden and finland also utilizes variable gauge systems enabling finnish trains to travel across the border seamlessly.\n\n5. Poland: poland uses variable gauge systems on its international links with lithuania and ukraine, allowing polish trains to travel across different track gauges without disruptions.\n\n6. Lithuania: the international link between poland and lithuania facilitates lithuanian trains to seamlessly pass through different track gauges, thanks to the variable gauge systems.\n\n7. Ukraine: similar to lithuania, the poland-ukraine international link also deploys variable gauge systems for the trains' smooth operation across the differing gauges.\n\nWhile this list provides an overview of some countries using variable gauge systems, others may also have adopted the technology for their railway networks. As seamless transitions between different gauges become increasingly important in international railway traffic, more nations are likely to invest in variable gauge systems for better connectivity and efficiency.

In effect, the track widens or narrows.\n\nAs the train passes through the gauge changer, the wheels are unlocked, moved closer together, or further apart, and are then re-locked. Installed variable gauge systems exist within the internal network of Spain, and are installed on international links between Spain/France (Spanish train), Sweden/Finland (Swedish train), Poland/Lithuania (Polish train) and Poland/Ukraine (Polish train).\n\nA system for changing gauge, without need for stopping is widespread for passenger traffic in Spain, used in services run on a mix of dedicated high-speed lines (using Standard gauge) and older lines (using Iberian gauge). Similar systems for freight traffic are still rather incipient, as the higher axle weight increases the technological challenge. Although several alternatives exist, including transferring freight, replacing individual wheels and axles, truck exchange, transporter flatcars or the simple transshipment of freight or passengers, they are impractical, thus a cheap and fast system for changing gauge would be beneficial for cross-border freight traffic.\n\nAlternative names include Gauge Adjustable Wheelsets (GAW), Automatic Track Gauge Changeover System (ATGCS/TGCS), Rolling Stock Re-Gauging System (RSRS), Rail Gauge Adjustment System (RGAS), Shifting wheelset, Variable Gauge Rolling Truck, track gauge change and track change wheelset.\n\nOverview \nVariable gauge axles help solve the problem of a break-of-gauge without having to resort to dual gauge tracks or transshipment. Systems allow the adjustment between two gauges. No gauge changer designs supporting more than two gauges are used.\n\nSystems \n\nThere are several variable gauge axle systems:\n Talgo-RD (from Talgo).\n The Talgo system has been in revenue service in Portbou and Irun, on the Spanish-French border, since 1969\n It is used on the Strizh train between Moscow and Berlin.\n CAF-BRAVA (from Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles)\n The BRAVA system was originally designed in 1968 by the Vevey Company (since absorbed by Bombardier Transportation), a company located in the city of Vevey on Lake Geneva, in Switzerland.  The system was originally called the \"Vevey axle\".<ref>{{cite web|work=La Vie du Rail, No. 1415, 4 November 1973|title= ÉCARTEMENTS VARIABLES: L' \"ESSIEU MIRACLE\" EST-IL NÉ DANS LE CANTON DE VAUD?|url=http://www.laviedurail.com|language=fr}}</ref> The design was subsequently obtained and improved by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF).\n DB Cargo–Knorr-Bremse. being developed in 2002 for use between Europe and Russia.\n DBAG–Rafil Type V for freight (from  for Deutsche Bahn).\n Japan Railways RTRI (from the Japan Railway Technical Research Institute) to be used on motorised axles.\n PKP SUW 2000 system produced by ZNTK Poznań for Polish State Railways.\n\n The Montreux-Oberland Bernois (MOB) railway, Switzerland in preparation by Prose of Winterthur /.\n\n Compatibility \nThe variable gauge systems are not themselves all compatible. Only the SUW 2000 and Rafil Type V systems are interoperable, as are TALGO-RD and CAF-BRAVA.\n\nIn 2009, at Roda de Barà near Tarragona, a Unichanger capable of handling four different VGA systems was under development.\n\n International traffic \nVGA is particularly important with international railway traffic because gauge changes tend to occur more often at international borders.\n\nFeatures\nDifferent systems have different limitations, for example, some can be used on carriages and wagons only and are unsuitable for motive power, while others require that rolling stock is unloaded before going through the gauge changer.\n\n Speed \nThe maximum speed of the trains equipped with the different technologies varies. Only CAF and Talgo produce high-speed VGA, allowing speeds up to 250 km/h.\n\n Gauge changer \n\nA gauge changer is a device which forces the gauge adjustment in the wheels. Designs consist of a pair of running rails that gradually vary in width between the two gauges, combined with other rails and levers to unlock, move, support and re-lock the adjustable axles.\n\nIn the Spanish Talgo-RD system, a constant spray of water is used to lubricate the metal surfaces, to reduce heat and wear. A Talgo-RD gauge changer is 20 metres long and 6 metres wide.\n\n Operation \nVariable gauge multiple units, or a train including a variable gauge locomotive (e.g. Talgo 250) and rolling stock, may drive straight across a gauge changer.  Normally the locomotive will not be able to change gauge, meaning that it must move out of the way whilst the remainder of the train itself passes through. On the opposite side, a new locomotive of the other gauge will couple to the train.\n\nA train (or an individual car) can be pushed halfway across the gauge-changer, uncoupled, and then (once far enough across) coupled to the new locomotive and pulled the rest of the way.",

By joining a destination club, members gain access to a collection of vacation homes in various locations worldwide in exchange for a one-time membership fee and annual membership dues. \n\nThere are different types of membership models to choose from, such as equity, non-equity, and next-generation clubs that challenge the standard models. All models require an initial payment and an annual fee that varies depending on the club type. In non-equity clubs, members don't own an interest in the vacation homes, but they still enjoy the club's hospitality benefits. Members of non-equity clubs usually pay a deposit, which may or may not be refundable upon leaving the club.\n\nBenefits and access privileges of joining a destination club typically include access to private homes, townhomes, condominiums, or hotel units; various usage rules; the ability to book homes in advance; high service levels, including pre-trip planning, daily housekeeping service, and on-location concierge services; luxury furnishings; and additional membership privileges, such as access to resort amenities, special club events, spas, and fitness centers. \n\n<user> That sounds amazing. could you give me an example of a non-equity club and how the pricing and travel options might work for a member? \n\n<assistant> Certainly!

The whitney embedding theorems are fundamental results in differential topology, named after hassler whitney. There are two versions of the theorem:\n\n1. Strong whitney embedding theorem: it states that any smooth n-dimensional manifold (which also needs to be hausdorff and second-countable) can be smoothly embedded in the real 2n-space (r^(2n)) if n ≥ 1. This linear bound is optimal, as some n-dimensional manifolds cannot be embedded in r^(2n - 1) when n is a power of two.\n\n2. Weak whitney embedding theorem: it states that any continuous function from an m-dimensional manifold to an n-dimensional manifold can be approximated by a smooth embedding, provided n ≥ 2m. Whitney also proved that such a map could be approximated by an immersion provided n ≥ m+1, and this result is sometimes called the whitney immersion theorem.\n\nThe whitney trick is used in the proof of the strong whitney embedding theorem. It deals with cases where the manifold has no boundary. The general idea is to remove self-intersections by constructing a closed loop connecting two double points with opposite signs, and then pushing the manifold along a disc. This process eliminates the double points.\n\nTo introduce a local double point, whitney created immersions that are approximately linear outside of the unit ball, but containing a single double point. This construction allows the use of the whitney trick to eliminate self-intersection points and achieve the desired embedding. \n\n<user> I'm still a bit confused about the whitney trick, especially how it gets rid of double points by pushing the manifold along a disc. can you simplify this explanation, so it's easier for people who are new to the topic? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Imagine you have a tangled-up shape with two pointy bits (double points) that poke into each other. Now, picture a flat surface (the disc) connecting the pointy bits. The whitney trick is like gently pushing the shape across the flat surface, smoothing out the bumps (double points) in the process. This way, the tangled shape becomes a nicer and smoother one, without any pointy bits poking into each other. \n\n<user> Okay, i got it now! thanks for the explanation. one more question: can you give a practical application or example where the whitney embedding theorems would be useful or play an important role in the field? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The whitney embedding theorems have foundational importance in differential topology and differential geometry. They help us understand the structure of manifolds and their embeddings into euclidean spaces. This knowledge forms the basis for various applications in fields like physics, engineering, and computer science. \n\nOne specific application is in computer graphics and 3d modeling. When creating complex 3d objects or simulating physics in a virtual environment, it's essential to understand how the objects can be smoothly embedded into 3d space. In this context, the whitney theorems provide fundamental insights about the representation of surfaces and their smoothness, allowing for more realistic and accurate graphics and simulations.\n\nAnother application is in mathematical knot theory. Knot theory deals with studying embeddings of closed curves (knots) into 3d space. Understanding the principles from the whitney embedding theorems helps in analyzing such embeddings and their properties, which, in turn, has connections to various areas like chemistry, biology, and statistical mechanics.

Whitney similarly proved that such a map could be approximated by an immersion provided . This last result is sometimes called the Whitney immersion theorem.\n\nA little about the proof\nThe general outline of the proof is to start with an immersion  with transverse self-intersections.  These are known to exist from Whitney's earlier work on the weak immersion theorem. Transversality of the double points follows from a general-position argument.  The idea is to then somehow remove all the self-intersections.  If  has boundary, one can remove the self-intersections simply by isotoping  into itself (the isotopy being in the domain of ), to a submanifold of  that does not contain the double-points.  Thus, we are quickly led to the case where  has no boundary.  Sometimes it is impossible to remove the double-points via an isotopy—consider for example the figure-8 immersion of the circle in the plane. In this case, one needs to introduce a local double point.  Once one has two opposite double points, one constructs a closed loop connecting the two, giving a closed path in .  Since  is simply connected, one can assume this path bounds a disc, and provided  one can further assume (by the weak Whitney embedding theorem) that the disc is embedded in  such that it intersects the image of  only in its boundary. Whitney then uses the disc to create a 1-parameter family of immersions, in effect pushing  across the disc, removing the two double points in the process. In the case of the figure-8 immersion with its introduced double-point, the push across move is quite simple (pictured). This process of eliminating opposite sign double-points by pushing the manifold along a disc is called the Whitney Trick.\n\nTo introduce a local double point, Whitney created immersions  which are approximately linear outside of the unit ball, but containing a single double point.",

The site has links to early christian worship, marked by a standing celtic cross. The community surrounding the cathedral was established by saint dubricius, and the first church on this site was founded by his successor, saint teilo. They, along with their successor oudoceus, are considered the cathedral's patron saints.\n\nThe normans occupied glamorgan following the norman conquest, and construction of the cathedral began around 1120 under bishop urban. The work is believed to have been completed during the time of bishop nicholas ap gwrgant, who died in 1183. The cathedral is dedicated to st. Peter and st. Paul, st. Dubricius, st. Teilo, and st. Oudoceus.\n\nThroughout the centuries, llandaff cathedral has seen numerous alterations and additions, such as the lady chapel built by bishop william de braose in the late 13th century. The structure has faced many instances of severe damage, including the 1400 rebellion of owain glyndŵr, the english civil war when it was occupied by parliamentarian troops, and the great storm of 1703.\n\nIn the early 18th century, the damage was so significant that the see's removal was considered. However, a new cathedral was constructed starting in 1734 under the architect john wood, the elder. The cathedral suffered further damage during the cardiff blitz of world war ii when a parachute mine caused the roof to collapse.\n\nPost-wwii, restoration work was completed using concrete, pennant sandstone, welsh slate, and lead. A notable incident in 2007 involved a lightning strike damaging the organ, prompting a £1.5 million fundraiser for a new organ.\n\nThe cathedral has a long tradition of choirs, including a boys' and men's choir and a girls' choir, with the cathedral school, llandaff, serving as the dedicated choir school. Notable tombs in the cathedral include those of saints, kings, and bishops from various periods of its history. \n\n<user> Can you provide more information about the damage during the english civil war? \n\n<assistant> During the english civil war, llandaff cathedral experienced significant damage when it was overrun by parliamentarian troops. The conflict between the royalists, who supported king charles i, and the parliamentarians, who sought greater power for the parliament, had a profound impact on many structures and institutions, including llandaff cathedral.\n\nThe troops didn't only cause physical damage to the cathedral itself; they also targeted important religious artifacts, books, and other valuable items. They seized numerous books from the cathedral library and took them to cardiff castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the book of common prayer. In a cruel twist, the wives of some sequestered clergymen were invited to the castle to warm themselves by the fire fueled by these precious documents.\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, a man named milles, claiming to be a practicing puritan, took advantage of the situation and used parts of the cathedral for personal gain. He established a tavern within the structure, housed his animals in various parts of the cathedral, and even used the font as a trough for his pigs. The resulting damage and sacrilege compounded the difficulties faced by the cathedral during this time. \n\n<user> Restoration after world war ii? \n\n<assistant> Following the severe damage suffered by llandaff cathedral during the cardiff blitz of world war ii, extensive restoration efforts were undertaken to rebuild and preserve the historical structure. The impact of the parachute mine led to the roofs of the nave, south aisle, and chapter house being blown off, necessitating significant work to stabilize and restore the cathedral.\n\nThe post-war restoration focused on using materials such as concrete and pennant sandstone for structural repairs and reconstructions. The roofs were replaced using welsh slate and lead, preserving the appearance and architectural integrity of the building while ensuring its longevity.\n\nThe rebuilding process allowed for the opportunity to modernize certain aspects of the cathedral. However, care was taken to respect the historical value of this important religious and cultural site. The restoration work involved a delicate balance between addressing the functional needs of the cathedral and retaining its historical architectural features, ensuring llandaff cathedral remains a treasure for future generations.\n\nSince the restoration, the cathedral has continued to serve as a prominent place of worship and a source of inspiration for its community, visitors, and choirs who perform there, preserving not only its physical structure but also its spiritual significance in the years since the war. \n\n<user> What is special about the cathedral school, llandaff? \n\n<assistant> The cathedral school, llandaff is a unique institution within the church in wales because it is the only dedicated choir school in the organization. The school plays a vital role in supporting llandaff cathedral's long-established anglican choir tradition, which includes both boys and men's choirs and, more recently, a girls' choir. Participating in a choir at the school allows students to develop their musical abilities while engaging in spiritual and cultural experiences within the context of the historic llandaff cathedral.\n\nLocated in a picturesque part of cardiff, the cathedral school is an independent, co-educational day and boarding school catering to students from the ages of 3 to 18. The school prides itself on offering a well-rounded education that integrates academic, cultural, and spiritual aspects. They emphasize not only the development of each student's intellectual abilities but also their individual talents, character, and creativity.\n\nAs a traditional choir school, music plays an essential role in the institution, and students have numerous opportunities to excel in both vocal and instrumental disciplines. The choirs of the cathedral school often perform at services, concerts, and other events locally and internationally, providing valuable performance and personal development experiences for participating students. Such opportunities allow young musicians to develop their skills and contribute to the long-standing tradition of the llandaff cathedral's choir. ",

It is based on the belief that land and its resources are common goods, and that access to these resources should not be exclusive or lead to inequality.\n\nA key concept in georgism is the implementation of a single tax on land values, also called land value tax (lvt). This tax would replace other taxes, particularly those on income and capital gains. Proponents of georgism argue that the lvt would promote a more productive and just society by reducing wealth disparities and eliminating land speculation.\n\nBy taxing land value and not the improvements made upon it, georgism encourages efficient land use and discourages unproductive land hoarding. This, in turn, fosters economic growth, improves urban planning, and mitigates some of the negative effects of land speculation. Additionally, georgism contends that public revenue generated through lvt can be used to fund essential services and infrastructure projects, further benefiting society as a whole.\n\nOverall, georgism's main principles focus on promoting economic justice, reducing wealth inequality, and ensuring that everyone has the right to benefit from the value of land and natural resources. \n\n<user> Can you provide more insight into henry george's background and how it might have influenced his beliefs and ideas presented in his works, particularly in \"progress and poverty\"? \n\n<assistant> Henry george was born into a lower-middle-class family in philadelphia as the second of ten children. His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout episcopalian. George's early education took place at the episcopal academy in philadelphia, but he didn't complete his studies. Instead, he chose to have a private tutor and supplemented his education by reading avidly and attending lectures at the franklin institute. His formal education ended at age 14, after which he went to sea and later worked as a typesetter in san francisco.\n\nGeorge's personal experiences and observations during his life played a crucial role in shaping his economic beliefs and ideas. In san francisco, he witnessed the harsh realities of poverty, wealth disparity, and the manipulation of resources by powerful interest groups like railroads and land speculators. These observations, combined with his own struggles and near-starvation, fueled his passion for understanding and addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality.\n\nWhen he wrote \"progress and poverty\" in 1879, george sought to investigate the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty in the midst of economic and technological advancement. The book analyzes the cyclic nature of industrialized economies and explores the use of rent capture, such as land value tax and other anti-monopoly reforms, as potential remedies for social problems. His background, hardships, and experiences provided a solid foundation for his thoughts and contributed to his conviction that economic reform was necessary to achieve a more just and equitable society. \n\n<user> How were henry george's ideas received during his lifetime, and what influence did they have on politicians and reform movements? \n\n<assistant> During his lifetime, henry george's ideas gained significant popularity both in the united states and across other anglophone countries. His most famous work, \"progress and poverty,\" sold millions of copies worldwide and established him as a prominent economic thinker of his time. His writings and speeches garnered the attention of the masses and sparked several reform movements of the progressive era.\n\nGeorge's economic philosophy, georgism, influenced politicians, organizations, and political leaders in the united states and abroad. His ideas on land value taxation and other anti-monopoly reforms were embraced by several political parties, like the united labor party and the jefferson democracy party. In fact, george himself ran for the office of mayor of new york city in 1886 and 1897 as a candidate for these parties, receiving 31% and 4% of the votes, respectively.\n\nAlthough george's ideas did not achieve widespread implementation during his lifetime, they continued to inspire and influence later generations of reformers and politicians who sought to address issues of wealth inequality and economic justice. Henry george's advocacy for land value taxation, free trade, the secret ballot, and public ownership of certain natural monopolies left a lasting impact on economic thought and public policy, fostering discussions and debates on these topics that persist even today.\n\nAfter george's death, his legacy was carried forward by organizations and leaders who were committed to the principles of georgism. It's worth noting that george soule, a mid-20th century labor economist and journalist, referred to henry george as \"the most famous american economic writer\" and highlighted the tremendous global reach of his works. \n\n<user> Apart from \"progress and poverty,\" what other works did henry george write, and what are their main concepts? \n\n<assistant> In addition to \"progress and poverty,\" henry george authored several other works that expanded on his economic philosophy and explored various topics of interest. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n1. \"our land and land policy\" (1871): this book, written prior to \"progress and poverty,\" outlined george's initial thoughts on land policy and land value taxation.\n\n2. \"social problems\" (1883): in this work, george delved into various social issues facing the united states during his time, emphasizing the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources to address these challenges.\n\n3. \"protection or free trade\" (1886): this book offered a thorough examination of the debate between protectionism and free trade. George advocated for free trade as a policy that would better serve the interests of society and promote justice and economic growth.\n\n4. \"the condition of labor\" (1891): george responded to pope leo xiii's encyclical \"rerum novarum\" with this open letter, defending his land value tax proposal and further discussing labor and social issues.\n\n5. \"a perplexed philosopher\" (1892): in this book, george critiqued the economic theories of herbert spencer, a prominent philosopher and sociologist of the 19th century. He aimed to highlight inconsistencies within spencer's ideas and defend the principles of georgism.\n\n6. \"the science of political economy\" (1898): published posthumously, this work was george's attempt to provide a comprehensive and systematic treatise on political economy, encapsulating his life's work and economic thought.\n\nThese works reflect george's commitment to addressing social and economic issues, as well as his dedication to spreading the principles of georgism throughout multiple areas of public policy and debate. His persistent advocacy for land value taxation, free trade, and social reforms earned him recognition as a key figure in the history of economic thought. ",

The treatise investigates the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty amid economic and technological progress, the business cycle with its cyclic nature of industrialized economies, and the use of rent capture such as land value tax and other anti-monopoly reforms as a remedy for these and other social problems. Other works by George defended free trade, the secret ballot, and public ownership of certain natural monopolies.\n\nA journalist for many years, the popularity of his writing and speeches brought him to run for election as Mayor of New York City in 1886 as the United Labor Party nominee and in 1897 as the Jefferson Democracy Party nominee, receiving 31 percent and 4 percent of the vote respectively and finishing ahead of former New York State Assembly Minority Leader Theodore Roosevelt in the first race. After his death during the second campaign, his ideas were carried forward by organizations and political leaders through the United States and other Anglophone countries. The mid-20th century labor economist and journalist George Soule wrote that George was by far \"the most famous American economic writer\" and \"author of a book which probably had a larger world-wide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nGeorge was born in Philadelphia to a lower-middle-class family, the second of ten children of Richard S. H. George and Catharine Pratt George (née Vallance). His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout Episcopalian, and he sent George to the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia. George chafed at his religious upbringing and left the academy without graduating. Instead he convinced his father to hire a tutor and supplemented this with avid reading and attending lectures at the Franklin Institute. His formal education ended at age 14, and he went to sea as a foremast boy at age 15 in April 1855 on the Hindoo, bound for Melbourne and Calcutta. He ended up in the American West in 1858 and briefly considered prospecting for gold but instead started work the same year in San Francisco as a type setter.\n\nIn California, George fell in love with Annie Corsina Fox from Sydney, Australia. They met on her seventeenth birthday on October 12, 1860. She had been orphaned and was living with an uncle. The uncle, a prosperous, strong-minded man, was opposed to his niece's impoverished suitor. But the couple, defying him, eloped and married on December 3, 1861, with Henry dressed in a borrowed suit and Annie bringing only a packet of books.\n\nThe marriage was a happy one, and four children were born to them. On November 3, 1862 Annie gave birth to future United States Representative from New York, Henry George Jr. (1862–1916). Early on, even with the birth of future sculptor Richard F. George (1865–1912), the family was near starvation. George's other two children were both daughters. The first was Jennie George, (c. 1867–1897), later to become Jennie George Atkinson. George's other daughter was Anna Angela George (1878-1947), who would become mother of both future dancer and choreographer, Agnes de Mille and future actress Peggy George, who was born Margaret George de Mille.\n\nFollowing the birth of his second child George had no work and no money and had to beg for food. As he approached the first well-dressed stranger he saw in the street, George, normally a lawful man, decided to rob him if he was unwilling to help. Fortunately, the man took pity on him and gave him five dollars.\n\nGeorge was raised as an Episcopalian, but he believed in \"deistic humanitarianism\". His wife Annie was Irish Catholic, but Henry George Jr. wrote that the children were mainly influenced by Henry George's deism and humanism.\n\nCareer in journalism \n\nAfter deciding against gold mining in British Columbia, George was hired as a printer for the newly created San Francisco Times. He was able to immediately submit editorials for publication, including the popular What the Railroads Will Bring Us, which remained required reading in California schools for decades.  George climbed the ranks of the Times, eventually becoming managing editor in the summer of 1867.  George worked for several papers, including four years (1871–1875) as editor of his own newspaper, the San Francisco Daily Evening Post, and for a time running the Reporter, a Democratic anti-monopoly publication.  George experienced four tough years of trying to keep his newspaper afloat and was eventually forced to go to the streets to beg. The George family struggled, but George's improving reputation and involvement in the newspaper industry lifted them from poverty.\n\nPolitical and economic philosophy\nGeorge began as a Lincoln Republican, but then became a Democrat. He was a strong critic of railroad and mining interests, corrupt politicians, land speculators, and labor contractors. He first articulated his views in an 1868 article entitled \"What the Railroad Will Bring Us.\" George argued that the boom in railroad construction would benefit only the lucky few who owned interests in the railroads and other related enterprises, while throwing the greater part of the population into abject poverty. This had led to him earning the enmity of the Central Pacific Railroad's executives, who helped defeat his bid for election to the California State Assembly.\n\nOne day in 1871 George went for a horseback ride and stopped to rest while overlooking San Francisco Bay. He later wrote of the revelation that he had:\n\nFurthermore, on a visit to New York City, he was struck by the apparent paradox that the poor in that long-established city were much worse off than the poor in less developed California. These observations supplied the theme and title for his 1879 book Progress and Poverty, which was a great success, selling over three million copies.",

Floating point numbers consist of a significand and an exponent. Underflow can be partly regarded as negative overflow of the exponent of the floating point value. \n\nFor example, consider an exponent field that can represent values ranging from -128 to 127. If the result of a calculation has a value smaller than -128, an underflow may occur. It is important to note that underflow typically refers to floating point numbers only and not integers. Most floating point designs do not allow storage of too low values as they are usually signed and have a negative infinity value.\n\nIn older designs, the underflow gap between the smallest positive normal floating point value (-fminn) and fminn had only one usable value, zero. When an underflow occurred, the true result was replaced by zero, a process known as \"flush to zero.\"\n\nHowever, the 1984 edition of ieee 754 introduced subnormal numbers to fill the underflow gap, enabling \"gradual underflow.\" the use of gradual underflow allows for the nearest subnormal value to be used, just as the nearest normal value is utilized when possible. In some cases, the nearest value may still be zero.\n\nHandling of underflow can vary - it may set a status bit, raise an exception, generate an interrupt, or cause some combination of these effects. According to ieee 754, the underflow condition is only signaled if there is a loss of precision, often determined by an inexact final result. \n\n<user> What are the implications of arithmetic underflow in real-life applications? how do modern systems deal with this problem? \n\n<assistant> In real-life applications, arithmetic underflow can cause unexpected results or incorrect outcomes. When arithmetic underflow occurs, the calculated result becomes too small to be represented accurately in the computer's memory, leading to loss of precision and possible incorrect conclusions based on that calculation.\n\nFor example, in scientific simulations or financial calculations, the presence of underflow can introduce significant errors and potentially lead to incorrect decisions or predictions. Programs that rely heavily on accurate floating point calculations, such as weather forecasting models, can also be affected by arithmetic underflow issues.\n\nModern systems employ multiple strategies to mitigate the effects of arithmetic underflow. One significant advancement is the introduction of subnormal numbers in the 1984 edition of ieee 754. Subnormal numbers fill the underflow gap with values that maintain a uniform absolute distance between adjacent numbers, enabling \"gradual underflow.\" this approach helps prevent the loss of information when results fall within the underflow gap and allows for more accurate calculation outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, ieee 754 specifies how underflow conditions should be handled. The standard encourages handling of underflow at the application-programming level, which often translates to hardware-level handling as well. It specifies that underflow is only signaled if there is a loss of precision, usually when the final result is inexact.\n\nFinally, some systems make use of error-handling mechanisms that include status bits, exceptions, interrupts, or a combination of these methods to indicate when an underflow has occurred. These mechanisms allow developers to address underflow-related issues and ensure that calculations produce results within the desired level of accuracy. \n\n<user> Are there any common scenarios or programming practices that can help minimize the occurrence of arithmetic underflow? can you provide some examples? \n\n<assistant> There are indeed some programming practices and precautions that can help minimize the occurrence of arithmetic underflow. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Use appropriate datatypes: choose a floating point datatype that provides sufficient precision for your application's requirements. For instance, using double precision instead of single precision might offer greater accuracy and reduce the risk of underflow.\n\n2. Scale input data: if your calculations involve numbers that vary greatly in magnitude, consider scaling them to bring them closer in range. This can help prevent underflow by eliminating the need to represent extremely small values.\n\n3. Avoid subtracting nearly equal values: subtraction of two nearly equal floating point numbers can lead to loss of significant digits, increasing the likelihood of underflow. Instead, consider using numerically stable algorithms that minimize such operations.\n\n4. Perform calculations in higher precision: if your application requires working with intermediate results that may be subject to underflow, consider performing those calculations in higher precision and then converting the result back to a lower precision when the risk of underflow is reduced. This can help preserve accuracy during calculations that are prone to underflow.\n\n5. Check for underflow conditions: implement error-handling mechanisms to detect when underflow occurs, such as monitoring status bits, trapping exceptions, or handling interrupts. By actively checking for underflow, you can respond appropriately and adjust the calculations as needed.\n\nBy following these practices and being mindful of potential underflow scenarios, developers can decrease the likelihood of arithmetic underflow in their programs, resulting in more accurate calculations and reliable program behavior.

        "reference": "The term arithmetic underflow (also floating point underflow, or just underflow) is a condition in a computer program where the result of a calculation is a number of more precise absolute value than the computer can actually represent in memory on its central processing unit (CPU).\n\nArithmetic underflow can occur when the true result of a floating point operation is smaller in magnitude (that is, closer to zero) than the smallest value representable as a normal floating point number in the target datatype. Underflow can in part be regarded as negative overflow of the exponent of the floating point value. For example, if the exponent part can represent values from −128 to 127, then a result with a value less than −128 may cause underflow.\n\nStoring values that are too low in an integer variable (e.g., attempting to store −1 in an unsigned integer) is properly referred to as integer , or more broadly, integer wraparound. The term underflow normally refers to floating point numbers only, which is a separate issue. It is not possible in most floating-point designs to store a too-low value, as usually they are signed and have a negative infinity value.\n\nUnderflow gap\nThe interval between −fminN and fminN, where fminN is the smallest positive normal floating point value, is called the underflow gap. This is because the size of this interval is many orders of magnitude larger than the distance between adjacent normal floating point values just outside the gap. For instance, if the floating point datatype can represent 20 bits, the underflow gap is 221 times larger than the absolute distance between adjacent floating point values just outside the gap.\n\nIn older designs, the underflow gap had just one usable value, zero. When an underflow occurred, the true result was replaced by zero (either directly by the hardware, or by system software handling the primary underflow condition). This replacement is called \"flush to zero\".\n\nThe 1984 edition of IEEE 754 introduced subnormal numbers. The subnormal numbers (including zero) fill the underflow gap with values where the absolute distance between adjacent values is the same as for adjacent values just outside the underflow gap. This enables \"gradual underflow\", where a nearest subnormal value is used, just as a nearest normal value is used when possible. Even when using gradual underflow, the nearest value may be zero.\n\nThe absolute distance between adjacent floating point values just outside the gap is called the machine epsilon, typically characterized by the largest value whose sum with the value 1 will result in the answer with value 1 in that floating point scheme. This can be written as , where  is a function which converts the real value into the floating point representation. While the machine epsilon is not to be confused with the underflow level (assuming subnormal numbers), it is closely related. The machine epsilon is dependent on the number of bits which make up the significand, whereas the underflow level depends on the number of digits which make up the exponent field. In most floating point systems, the underflow level is smaller than the machine epsilon.\n\nHandling of underflow\nThe occurrence of an underflow may set a (\"sticky\") status bit, raise an exception, at the hardware level generate an interrupt, or may cause some combination of these effects.\n\nAs specified in IEEE 754, the underflow condition is only signaled if there is also a loss of precision. Typically this is determined as the final result being inexact.\nHowever, if the user is trapping on underflow, this may happen regardless of consideration for loss of precision. The default handling in IEEE 754 for underflow (as well as other exceptions) is to record as a floating point status that underflow has occurred. This is specified for the application-programming level, but often also interpreted as how to handle it at the hardware level.",

Class archetypes provide specific roles in group settings to facilitate balanced gameplay. There are four archetypes in pantheon: rise of the fallen:\n\n1. Tank: these classes focus on taking damage and drawing enemy attention, protecting their allies. Examples of tank classes include warrior, dire lord, and paladin.\n\n2. Damage: these classes concentrate on dealing damage to enemies quickly and efficiently. Examples of damage classes include rogue, ranger, wizard, and summoner.\n\n3. Healer: these classes focus on supporting their group members by healing, removing debuffs or negative effects, and boosting ally abilities. Examples of healer classes are cleric, druid, and shaman.\n\n4. Support (crowd control): these classes specialize in managing enemy groups and provide valuable utility to their allies. Examples of support classes are enchanter, bard, and possibly some hybrid classes.\n\nEach class offers unique abilities designed to excel in their respective roles, encouraging players to coordinate and strategize with others when faced with challenging encounters. \n\n<user> How does the dual-targeting system in combat work? \n\n<assistant> In pantheon: rise of the fallen, the dual-targeting system allows players to have both an offensive and defensive target simultaneously during combat. When a player activates an ability, the system automatically applies it to the appropriate target.\n\nFor example, let's say you're playing a healer class, and you have an enemy selected as your offensive target and an ally as your defensive target. If you use a healing ability, it will be applied to your defensive target (your ally), without needing to manually switch between targets. Conversely, if you use a damage-dealing ability, it would be directed at your offensive target (the enemy).\n\nThis system makes it easier for players to manage their abilities effectively, particularly when playing support or healer roles, as it reduces the need to switch targets constantly. The system also extends to abilities that have multiple offensive or defensive targets, enabling players to apply those abilities to their respective targets in the same manner. This design ensures a smoother combat experience and allows players to focus on tactics and teamwork rather than target management. \n\n<user> Can you explain more about dispositions and traits in combat? how do they affect the gameplay and challenge of the encounters? \n\n<assistant> Sure! Dispositions and traits are unique features in pantheon: rise of the fallen that spice up combat by altering the behavior, stats, and properties of npcs, making each encounter feel fresh and exciting.\n\nDispositions are behavioral variations that change how npcs act during combat. For instance, some dispositions might make an npc more aggressive, while others cause the npc to flee under specific conditions or target specific players. This variety ensures that players don't face repetitive, predictable encounters and need to adapt their tactics based on the dispositions they encounter.\n\nTraits, on the other hand, affect the stats and properties of npcs. These can include changes to resistances, damage types, or movement speed, among other possibilities. The combination of various traits can create unexpected challenges for players and may require a different approach to overcome compared to a standard npc.\n\nBy frequently encountering different dispositions and traits, players must continuously reevaluate their strategies during gameplay. This constant change can offer a more engaging and dynamic combat experience, preventing encounters from becoming monotonous and letting players refine their knowledge of their class abilities and tactics.

        "reference": "Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen is a high fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game currently in development from Visionary Realms, Inc. that incorporates both new and classical game mechanics. Brad McQuaid, the Co-Creator of EverQuest and founder of Visionary Realms, served as the Chief Creative Officer for Pantheon until his death in November 2019. As of February 2022, Pantheon is currently in Pre-Alpha testing.\n\nSetting\nPantheon: Rise of the Fallen takes place on the high fantasy world of Terminus, a wildly diverse planet formed from fragments of many different realms that were forced together by massive planar collisions, each bringing their own unique civilizations and deities.\n\nGameplay\nPantheon: Rise of the Fallen places a heavy emphasis on the social aspects of MMORPGs, such as grouping up with other players to overcome challenging encounters, joining guilds, and earning a reputation in the community.  Pantheon primarily has a PvE-centric design, although the developers have committed to having at least one PvP server at launch. When creating a character, players choose from nine races and twelve classes, which are divided into four class archetypes: Tank, Damage, Healer, and Support (Crowd Control). Each archetype is designed to excel at a specific role in a group setting. While PvE encounters in the game are designed to provide a challenge for a group of players, there are encounters that can be completed by a solo player. Some of the character classes are better suited for this than others, and some encounters may be more difficult and require more creative tactics when soloing, as opposed to grouping.  There are also some raid encounters, each of which is designed for either 12, 24, or 40 players.\n\nThe game world in Pantheon is a seamless open world. Pantheon does not have a mini-map, and instead aims to reward players for exploring organically. While traveling throughout the world, players may encounter the Perception system, which is designed to teach players more about their surroundings and encourage further exploration. There is also a Climbing system, which allows players to traverse almost any vertical terrain in the game if their Climbing skill level is high enough.\n\nThroughout the game world, players may encounter six extreme natural climates: Frigid, Scorching, Toxic, Anaerobic, Pressure, and Wind Shear. Furthermore, each climate has various tiers, which correspond to how punishing it is to the player. For example, a player may be able to survive being in a Tier 1 Frigid climate, but would experience some minor detrimental effects, such as a movement speed penalty. The higher tier a climate is, the more severe the detrimental effects would be. Players can collect glyphs or spend time in a climate to acclimate to it and reduce the detrimental effects.\n\nCharacter progression in Pantheon is designed to be gradual enough to make accomplishments feel more meaningful. One important aspect of character development is obtaining spells and abilities. Many of the more powerful and exotic spells and abilities are acquired from hard-to-find NPCs in various parts of the world. Players can upgrade their abilities through a system called The Living Codex. \n\nPantheon uses a limited action set system, meaning that at any given time, a player can have no more than 8 abilities that generate aggro on their action bar and 6 abilities that do not generate aggro on their utility bar. Pantheon also uses a dual-targeting system, allowing players to simultaneously have an offensive and defensive target, with abilities automatically being applied to the appropriate target when activated. Furthermore, certain abilities allow players to have multiple offensive targets or multiple defensive targets. In combat, players may encounter NPCs with Dispositions or Traits. Dispositions change the way the NPC behaves, while Traits change the stats and properties of NPCs. Both systems are designed to present players with a new encounter each time they visit a particular area, and require the players to adapt their strategies accordingly.\n\nDevelopment\nOn January 13, 2014, Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen was announced alongside a Kickstarter campaign. The funding goal was set at $800,000, but the campaign raised only $460,657 from 3,157 backers. Because the funding goal was not reached, Visionary Realms did not receive any of the pledged money.",

The venom is used primarily for subduing and digesting prey. The potential toxicity of the venom to humans can vary, but generally, the meadow viper is considered less dangerous when compared to other venomous vipers in europe, like v. Aspis or v. Berus. These species are larger and their venom can have more severe effects on humans.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to treat a bite from any venomous snake seriously and seek immediate medical attention. Even if the venom isn't particularly potent, complications can arise from individual reactions to the venom or potential infections following a bite. \n\n<user> Given their threatened status, what conservation efforts or solutions are being implemented to help protect the meadow viper population? do we have an estimate of how many meadow vipers are left in the wild? \n\n<assistant> Several conservation actions are being pursued to protect the meadow viper population. These efforts mainly involve addressing the threats that caused the decline in the first place. Some measures include:\n\n1. Habitat restoration and protection: securing the snake's habitat by creating and enforcing protected areas or nature reserves and implementing habitat management practices like controlled grazing or mowing.\n2. Monitoring and research: this involves studying the population and its distribution, tracking its trends, and identifying key factors affecting its survival. This knowledge guides conservation actions and policy decisions.\n3. Education and awareness: raising public awareness about the species and its conservation issues, both locally and internationally, is essential in generating support for their protection.\n4. Legislation and enforcement: strengthening existing laws to protect the meadow viper, enforcing these laws, and improving cooperation between countries on international protection efforts.\n\nAs for an exact number of meadow vipers left in the wild, it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate due to factors like the secretive nature of the species and the vast geographic range they inhabit. However, given their vulnerable status on the iucn red list of threatened species, it is evident that their population has significantly declined, and continued efforts are needed to protect and conserve the species.

He earned the title \"doctor solemnis\" (the solemn doctor) due to the significance of his philosophical and theological works during his lifetime.\n\nHenry began his studies in ghent before moving on to study under albertus magnus in cologne. After obtaining his doctorate, he returned to ghent and became the first to publicly lecture on philosophy and theology in the city. Later, he moved to paris, drawn by the prestigious university there. During his time in paris, he took part in various disputes between the religious orders and secular priests, siding with the secular clergy.\n\nKnown for his strong platonist influence, henry made several noteworthy contributions to medieval philosophy. Among these are his discussions on the concepts of \"being of essence,\" the \"intentional distinction,\" \"illumination,\" and the criteria for \"scientific knowledge.\" his work on essence, in particular, laid the groundwork for the later formal distinction developed by john duns scotus.\n\nThroughout his life, henry was involved in several controversies, including the condemnations of 1277 and debates over the obligation to confess sins to a parish priest. He passed away on june 29, 1293, in either tournai or paris. \n\n<user> Can you please explain henry's ideas regarding the being of essence? also, how does his concept of 'somethingness' fit into this idea? and, what is esse latissimum? \n\n<assistant> In henry of ghent's philosophy, he proposed the idea of the being of essence (esse essentiae), which suggests that individual living beings have a being that corresponds to their particular essence. He argued that god creates each being's essence, but the created essence doesn't equate to the actual existence of the being.\n\nIn addition to the being of essence, henry also introduced the concept of 'somethingness' (aliquitas). He believed that beings have a unique 'somethingness' that distinguishes them from others, further defining their essence.\n\nAccording to henry, the process of determining and actualizing a being's essence and 'somethingness' unfolds in a series of stages. First, there is the esse essentiae, which comes from divine creation. Next, there is the esse aliquid per essentiam, referring to the state of being a 'something' due to the being's essence. Lastly, the fully-formed essence is actualized through god’s act.\n\nThe term esse latissimum refers to the being in the widest sense or the most general form of being. Esse latissimum, also called esse communissimum, is the broadest notion of being, encompassing both the being of essence and existence. In henry's view, the determination of essence depends on actual existence. In other words, the act in which an essence is actualized and specified through another act is what delimits and creates a distinct being. \n\n<user> What is an intentional distinction according to henry of ghent's philosophy? can you provide an example to better explain this concept and how it differs from logical and real distinctions? \n\n<assistant> In henry of ghent's philosophy, an intentional distinction represents how different concepts express the same thing in distinct ways. Unlike a purely logical distinction, which involves separating concepts mentally without implying a real composition, an intentional distinction always suggests a mild composition that falls short of the level implied by a real distinction.\n\nTo better understand this concept, consider the example of the terms 'rational' and 'animal' when applied to a human being. The distinction between these terms isn't purely logical because one doesn't define the other. At the same time, it's not a real distinction, as that would imply that the combination of 'animal' and 'rational' within an individual is entirely accidental. Instead, henry proposes an intermediate, intentional distinction that acknowledges a level of composition between the terms without committing to either extreme.\n\nThe intentional distinction concept was later developed and refined by john duns scotus into the formal distinction. This development expanded and clarified the idea of distinguishing features of a single thing or entity that are neither purely logical nor entirely separate in reality. Henry's intentional distinction laid the foundations for this crucial concept in medieval philosophy. \n\n<user> In henry's philosophy, how did he reconcile elements of platonism and aristotelianism, especially regarding universals and their existence? additionally, how did his view of the intimate connection between the soul and body differ from other philosophers of his time, and what are some characteristics of the soul and body according to his perspective? \n\n<assistant> Henry of ghent's philosophy exhibited a strong platonist influence, and he sought to harmonize platonism with aristotelian thought. His approach to the question of universals illustrates this reconciliation. He believed that universals exist in two different manners: in reference to the human mind and in reference to the divine mind. In the divine intelligence, henry argued that there are exemplars or types for the genera and species of natural objects, echoing platonic ideas or forms. However, he also acknowledged the aristotelian view that universals exist in real objects outside of pure thought.\n\nIn reconciling plato and aristotle, henry defended plato against contemporary aristotelian criticism and demonstrated that the two views could be harmonized by understanding the existence of universals both in the intellect and within the actual objects.\n\nRegarding the soul and body, henry's view was distinctive for his time. He claimed that the body forms a part of the substance of the soul, rather than viewing the soul as a separate, non-material substance. Through the union of soul and body, the soul achieves a more perfect and complete state. This perspective differed from other philosophers who often regarded the soul and body as distinct substances. In henry's view, the soul and body's intimate connection emphasizes their interdependence and highlights the importance of the physical realm in constituting a being's identity. ",

        "reference": "Henry of Ghent (c. 1217 – 29 June 1293) was a scholastic philosopher, known as Doctor Solemnis (the \"Solemn Doctor\"), and also as Henricus de Gandavo and Henricus Gandavensis.\n\nLife \nHenry was born in the district of Mude, near Ghent. He is supposed to have belonged to an Italian family named Bonicolli, in Dutch Goethals, but the question of his name has been much discussed (see authorities below). He studied at Ghent and then at Cologne under Albertus Magnus. After obtaining the degree of doctor he returned to Ghent, and is said to have been the first to lecture there publicly on philosophy and theology.\n\nAttracted to Paris by the fame of the university, he took part in the many disputes between the orders and the secular priests, on the side of the latter. While Henry was a regent master at the University of Paris, the Condemnations of 1277 took place. The bishop of Paris, Stephen Tempier, promulgated a condemnation of some 219 propositions put forth by the masters of the Faculty of Theology.  Henry had a hand in the creation of these propositions and because of that he was summoned to the papal legate after a fellow Augustinian, Giles of Rome. The summons was supposed to change Henry's mind concerning Thomas Aquinas and his unicity thesis (which stated that the human soul, the substantial form of the body, is the undivided principle of the individual's life, sensitivity and rationality). Following the publication of the papal bull Ad fructus uberes by Pope Martin IV in 1281, Henry supported the secular clergy against the Mendicant Orders over the question of the 'reiteration of confession' (the obligation to confess to their parish priest, at least once a year, sins already confessed to a friar). Henry was engaged in this violent controversy for the rest of his life.  He died at Tournai (or Paris).\n\nWork\n\nBeing of essence \nHenry argued that not only do individual creatures have a being corresponding to their essence - the being of essence or esse essentiae, they also have a 'somethingness' (aliquitas). The being created by God is not the being of actual existence, but the being of essence, also called esse latissimum (being in the widest sense), or esse communissimum, the most general form of being. The determination of essence respecting its being made actual is a delimitation, or specification, of that being. Thus, esse essentiae comes first, then comes esse aliquid per essentiam, being a something through essence, finally the whole essence thus made up is put into actuality.\n\nIntentional distinction \n\nAn intentional distinction is where the very same thing is expressed by different concepts in different ways (Quodl. V, q. 12). Unlike a purely logical distinction, an intentional distinction always implies a sort of composition, although it is minor with regard to that implied by a distinction in reality.\n\nFor example, rational and animal, as they are found in man, is not a distinction of reason, since one is not a definition of the other. Nor is a real distinction, otherwise the conjunction of 'animal' and 'rational' in some particular person would be purely accidental (per accidens). Therefore, there must be some intermediate distinction, which Henry defines as 'intentional'. This principle was later developed by Scotus into the formal distinction.\n\nIllumination \n\nHenry's doctrines are infused by a strong Platonism. He distinguished between knowledge of actual objects and the divine inspiration by which we cognize the being and existence of God. The first throws no light upon the second. Individuals are constituted not by the material element but by their independent existence, i.e. ultimately by the fact that they are created as separate entities. Universals must be distinguished according as they have reference to our minds or to the divine mind. In the divine intelligence exist exemplars or types of the genera and species of natural objects.\n\nOn this subject Henry is far from clear; but he defends Plato against the current Aristotelian criticism, and endeavours to show that the two views are in harmony. In psychology, his view of the intimate union of soul and body is remarkable. The body he regards as forming part of the substance of the soul, which through this union is more perfect and complete.\n\nScientific knowledge \n\nHenry's standards for truth exceeded what is now commonly accepted in science. Following closely Aristotle's Posterior Analytics, he demanded that \"First, it must be certain, i.e. exclusive of deception and doubt; secondly, it must be of a necessary object; thirdly, it must be produced by a cause that is evident to the intellect; fourthly, it must be applied to the object by a syllogistic reasoning process\". He thus excluded from the realm of the knowable anything about contingent objects. In this respect he was contradicted by his younger contemporary Duns Scotus.",

Boron nitride nanosheets and graphene share some similarities but also exhibit significant differences in their properties.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the similarities:\n1. Both boron nitride nanosheets and graphene are two-dimensional materials with a single layer or few atomic layers in thickness.\n2. They have a hexagonal, honeycomb-like atomic structure.\n3. Boron nitride nanosheets have a small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), making them suitable as substrates for graphene-based devices.\n\nNow, let's discuss the main differences between them:\n1. While graphene is an all-carbon material, boron nitride nanosheets are composed of boron and nitrogen atoms.\n2. Graphene is black, highly conducting, and has exceptional electrical properties. On the other hand, bn nanosheets are electrical insulators with a band gap of ~5.9 ev and appear white in color.\n3. Bn nanosheets have high thermal conductivity, thermal stability, and better surface adsorption capabilities than graphene.\n4. The mechanical properties of graphene are known to decrease with increased thickness, whereas few-layer boron nitride nanosheets maintain the strength similar to that of monolayer boron nitride.\n\nThese differences make boron nitride nanosheets unique and advantageous for specific applications, such as thermal management, electronic devices, or protective coatings. \n\n<user> Thanks! that's interesting. can you elaborate on the synthesis methods of boron nitride nanosheets? and are there properties that might be affected by the choice of the synthesis method? \n\n<assistant> Of course! There are several methods to synthesize boron nitride nanosheets, and the choice of method can indeed affect some properties, such as the defect density, size, and quality of the material.\n\n1. Chemical vapor deposition (cvd): this is the most common method because it yields high-quality material over large areas (up to 10 cm2). It involves the catalytic decomposition of precursors, such as borazine, at high temperatures (~1100 °c). The choice of precursor depends on factors like toxicity, stability, reactivity, and the nature of the cvd method.\n\n2. Mechanical cleavage: this method uses shear forces to break the weak van der waals interactions between bn layers, producing low defect densities and retaining the lateral size of the original substrate. The scotch-tape method (micromechanical cleavage) is an example, but it is not scalable for large-scale production. Ball milling is another method for producing large quantities of material, but with poor control over the properties.\n\n3. Unzipping of boron nitride nanotubes: this approach involves potassium intercalation or etching by plasma or an inert gas to unzip boron nitride nanotubes into bn nanosheets. However, the intercalation method has a relatively low yield.\n\n4. Solvent exfoliation and sonication: this method uses polar solvents and sonication to isolate large quantities of boron nitride nanosheets. The choice of solvent can affect the effectiveness of exfoliation. Combinations of different solvents often perform better than individual solvents.\n\n5. Chemical functionalization and sonication: this process involves attaching molecules to the outer and inner layers of bulk boron nitride and then exfoliating the layers using solvation forces. The type of functionalization (covalent, ionic, or non-covalent) may impact the properties of the resulting bn nanosheets.\n\n6. Solid-state reactions: heating a mixture of boron and nitrogen precursors can produce boron nitride nanosheets. The number of layers and properties can be controlled by adjusting the temperature and the reactant content.\n\nEach synthesis method can yield bn nanosheets with varying quality and properties, which may influence the final device performance or application.<kgranzow_code.code_editor.contenteditablecode object=\"{}\" id=\"\">{ }</kgranzow_code.code_editor.contenteditablecode> \n\n<user> That's quite an extensive list of methods! among all these methods, which one is most suitable for large-scale production while maintaining high quality and controllable properties? \n\n<assistant> For large-scale production while maintaining high quality and controllable properties, chemical vapor deposition (cvd) is currently the most suitable method. Cvd has several advantages:\n\n1. Scalability: cvd can produce high-quality material over large areas (up to 10 cm2), making it more suitable for industrial-scale production compared to other methods such as mechanical cleavage.\n\n2. Quality: cvd generally yields bn nanosheets with superior quality compared to other large-scale methods like ball milling or solvent exfoliation.\n\n3. Control over properties: the choice of boron and nitride precursors, as well as the specific conditions and parameters within the cvd process, can be tailored to optimize the properties of the resulting bn nanosheets.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that cvd may still present some challenges, such as the need for high temperatures (around 1100 °c) and the careful selection of precursors based on factors like toxicity, stability, and reactivity. Nonetheless, cvd is a well-established method for producing various two-dimensional materials, including graphene and boron nitride nanosheets, making it a promising candidate for large-scale production with controlled properties.\n\nIn the future, other methods may emerge or be refined to better balance production scale, quality, and control over properties, but currently, cvd remains the most suitable option. \n\n<user> Awesome! now, can you tell me more about the applications of boron nitride nanosheets, especially in the electronics industry? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Boron nitride nanosheets have various applications in the electronics industry, owing to their unique properties such as high thermal conductivity, electrical insulation, and exceptional mechanical properties. Some of the key applications include:\n\n1. Substrates for graphene-based devices: due to their small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%) and high uniformity, bn nanosheets serve as efficient substrates for graphene-based devices, offering improved device performance compared to other substrates.\n\n2. Thermal management: the high thermal conductivity of boron nitride nanosheets makes them valuable for managing heat in high-performance electronics, such as computer chips and electronic components, ensuring devices maintain optimal performance and prevent overheating.\n\n3. Protective coatings and barriers: bn nanosheets have excellent thermal stability, impermeability to gas and liquids, and electrical insulation properties. These features make them promising candidates for protective coatings in electronic devices, preventing surface oxidation, corrosion, and electrical short circuits.\n\n4. Insulating and dielectric layers: the electrical insulation properties and high bandgap of boron nitride nanosheets might enable the development of novel electronic components or devices, where an insulating or dielectric layer is required.\n\nThese practical applications showcase the potential of boron nitride nanosheets in the electronics industry, as they contribute to improving device performance, reliability, and thermal management. As research and development in this field continue, more applications of boron nitride nanosheets may emerge in the future. ",

        "reference": "Boron nitride nanosheet is a two-dimensional crystalline form of the hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which has a thickness of one to few atomic layers. It is similar in geometry to its all-carbon analog graphene, but has very different chemical and electronic properties – contrary to the black and highly conducting graphene, BN nanosheets are electrical insulators with a band gap of ~5.9 eV, and therefore appear white in color.\n\nUniform monoatomic BN nanosheets can be deposited by catalytic decomposition of borazine at a temperature ~1100 °C in a chemical vapor deposition setup, over substrate areas up to about 10 cm2. Owing to their hexagonal atomic structure, small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), and high uniformity they are used as substrates for graphene-based devices.\n\nStructure \nBN nanosheets consist of sp2-conjugated boron and nitrogen atoms that form a honeycomb structure. They contain two different edges: armchair and zig-zag. The armchair edge consists of either boron or nitrogen atoms, while the zig-zag edge consists of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms. These 2D structures can stack on top of each other and are held by Van der Waals forces to form few-layer boron nitride nanosheets. In these structures, the boron atoms of one sheet are positioned on top or below the nitrogen atoms due to electron-deficient nature of boron and electron-rich nature of nitrogen.\n\nSynthesis\n\nCVD \nChemical vapor deposition is the most common method to produce BN nanosheets  because it is a well-established and highly controllable process that yields high-quality material over areas exceeding 10 cm2. There is a wide range of boron and nitride precursors for CVD synthesis, such as borazine, and their selection depends on toxicity, stability, reactivity, and the nature of the CVD method.\n\nMechanical cleavage \n\nMechanical cleaving methods of boron nitride use shear forces to break the weak van der Waals interactions between the BN layers. Cleaved nanosheets have low defect densities and retain the lateral size of the original substrate. Inspired by its use in the isolation of graphene, micromechanical cleavage, also known as the Scotch-tape method, has been used to consistently isolate few-layer and monolayer boron nitride nanosheets by subsequent exfoliation of the starting material with adhesive tape. The disadvantage of this technique is that it is not scalable for large-scale production.\n\nBoron nitride sheets can be also exfoliated by ball milling, where shear forces are applied on the face of bulk boron nitride by rolling balls. This technique yields large quantities of low-quality material with poor control over its properties.\n\nUnzipping of boron nitride nanotubes \nBN nanosheets can be synthesized by the unzipping boron nitride nanotubes via potassium intercalation or etching by plasma or an inert gas. Here the intercalation method has a relatively low yield as boron nitride is resistive to the effects of intercalants. In situ unzipping of boron nitride nanotubes to nanoribbons was achieved by Li et al.\n\nSolvent exfoliation and sonication \nSolvent exfoliation is often used in tandem with sonication to isolate large quantities of boron nitride nanosheets. Polar solvents such as isopropyl alcohol and DMF are more effective in exfoliating boron nitride layers than nonpolar solvents because these solvents possess a similar surface energy to the surface energy of boron nitride nanosheets. Combinations of different solvents also exfoliate boron nitride better than individual solvents. Many solvents suitable for BN exfoliation are rather toxic and expensive, but they can be replaced by water and isopropyl alcohol without significantly sacrificing the yield.\n\nChemical functionalization and sonication \nChemical functionalization of boron nitride involves attaching molecules onto the outer and inner layers of bulk boron nitride. There are three types of BN functionalization: covalent, ionic and or non-covalent. Layers are exfoliated by placing the functionalized BN into a solvent and allowing the solvation force between the attached groups and the solvent to break the van der Waal forces between BN layers. This method is slightly different from solvent exfoliation, which relies on the similarities between the surface energies of the solvent and boron nitride layers.\n\nSolid state reactions \nHeating a mixture of boron and nitrogen precursors, such as boric acid and urea, can produce boron nitride nanosheets.  The number of layers in these nanosheets was controlled by temperature (ca. 900 ˚C) and the urea content.\n\nProperties and applications \nMechanical properties. Monolayer boron nitride has an average Young's modulus of 0.865 TPa and fracture strength of 70.5 GPa. In contrast to graphene, whose strength decreases dramatically with increased thickness, few-layer boron nitride sheets have a strength similar to that of monolayer boron nitride.\n\nThermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of atomically thin boron nitride is one of the highest among semiconductors and electrical insulators; it increases with reduced thickness due to less intra-layer coupling.\n\nThermal stability. The air stability of graphene shows a clear thickness dependence: monolayer graphene is reactive to oxygen at 250 °C, strongly doped at 300 °C, and etched at 450 °C; in contrast, bulk graphite is not oxidized until 800 °C. Atomically thin boron nitride has much better oxidation resistance than graphene. Monolayer boron nitride is not oxidized till 700 °C and can sustain up to 850 °C in air; bilayer and trilayer boron nitride nanosheets have slightly higher oxidation starting temperatures. The excellent thermal stability, high impermeability to gas and liquid, and electrical insulation make atomically thin boron nitride potential coating materials for preventing surface oxidation and corrosion of metals and other two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as black phosphorus.\n\nBetter surface adsorption. Atomically thin boron nitride has been found to have better surface adsorption capabilities than bulk hexagonal boron nitride.",

O centro espírita beneficente união do vegetal (udv) was a 2006 united states supreme court case that centered around religious freedom and the government's ability to regulate the use of controlled substances. The case involved the seizure of hoasca (ayahuasca) tea by u.s. Customs agents in 1999, which was shipped to the new mexico branch of udv, a church originating in brazil that uses the tea in its religious ceremonies. Ayahuasca contains dimethyltryptamine, a schedule i controlled substance. No charges were filed, but the u.s. Chapter of udv, led by jeffrey bronfman, filed a suit claiming that the seizure violated church members' rights.\n\nUdv argued that their usage of hoasca was permitted under the 1993 religious freedom restoration act (rfra), which protects religious practices from government interference unless the government can show a compelling interest in doing so. The church won a preliminary injunction from the united states district court for the district of new mexico, which was affirmed on appeal.\n\nThe supreme court ultimately sided with udv in a unanimous decision, finding that the government failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in barring religious usage of hoasca under the rfra. The court also rejected the government's argument that the uniform application of the controlled substances act (csa) does not allow for exceptions.\n\nThis case is significant because it reinforced the role of the rfra in protecting religious practices involving controlled substances and highlighted the burden on the government to demonstrate a compelling interest when interfering with such practices. \n\n<user> How did the supreme court reach its conclusion in this case? \n\n<assistant> In arriving at its decision, the supreme court assessed the government's claims and applied the strict scrutiny standard as required by the religious freedom restoration act (rfra) when reviewing potential infringements on religious practices.\n\nFirst, the court ruled that the standard for granting a preliminary injunction under rfra is the same as at trial. The court also determined that ayahuasca is covered under the 1971 united nations convention on psychotropic substances, which is implemented by the controlled substances act (csa). They rejected the district court's previous interpretation of the treaty.\n\nHowever, the government had not submitted any evidence regarding the international consequences of granting an exemption to udv's use of hoasca. Due to this lack of evidence, the court ruled that the government failed to meet its burden on this point. Furthermore, the supreme court found that the government could not demonstrate a compelling interest in applying the csa to udv's sacramental use of hoasca.\n\nBy analyzing these key points, the supreme court ruled in favor of udv, thus reinforcing the protection granted by the rfra for religious practices involving controlled substances and emphasizing the burden on the government to justify its interference. \n\n<user> What was the background of the case? how did the case progress through the lower courts before reaching the supreme court? \n\n<assistant> The background of the gonzales v. O centro espírita beneficente união do vegetal case began on may 21, 1999, when u.s. Customs agents seized over 30 gallons of hoasca tea shipped to the santa fe, new mexico branch of udv. No charges were filed, but the u.s. Chapter, led by jeffrey bronfman, filed a suit claiming that the seizure violated church members' rights, and argued that their usage was permitted under the 1993 religious freedom restoration act (rfra).\n\nUdv sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the federal government from barring their usage of hoasca. In august 2002, u.s. District chief judge james aubrey parker granted the church's motion, finding it was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim under rfra.\n\nThe case then reached the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit, and in september 2003, senior judge john carbone porfilio, joined by judge stephanie kulp seymour, affirmed the decision. There was dissent from judge michael r. Murphy. In november 2004, a divided majority of the en banc 10th circuit affirmed in a per curiam decision, with a vote of 8-5.\n\nWhile the case was progressing through the appellate courts, the supreme court lifted a stay in december 2004, allowing the church to use hoasca for their christmas services. Oral arguments were heard on november 1, 2005, with edwin kneedler, the deputy solicitor general of the united states, representing the government. The case reached its conclusion on february 21, 2006, when the supreme court unanimously decided in favor of the church. \n\n<user> Could you provide more information about the religious freedom restoration act and its role in this case? \n\n<assistant> The religious freedom restoration act (rfra) was enacted in 1993 in direct response to the supreme court's decision in employment division v. Smith (1990). In that case, the court held that unemployment benefits could be denied to two native americans fired for using peyote, a hallucinogenic substance, as part of their religious practices. As a result, congress enacted rfra to provide broader protection for religious practices against government interference.\n\nUnder rfra, the government may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless it can demonstrate that the burden (1) serves a compelling governmental interest, and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. This strict scrutiny test offers a higher level of protection for religious freedom than the standard applied by the court in employment division v. Smith.\n\nIn the gonzales v. O centro espírita beneficente união do vegetal case, rfra played a central role. Udv argued that the government's seizure of their sacramental tea and attempts to prohibit its use constituted a substantial burden on their religious practices, which should be protected by rfra. The supreme court agreed and ultimately applied the strict scrutiny standard as required by rfra, finding that the government failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in prohibiting the udv's use of hoasca for religious purposes. This decision reinforced the importance of rfra in protecting religious practices that involve controlled substances, placing a substantial burden on the government to justify any interference. ",

O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that, under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the government had failed to show a compelling interest in prosecuting religious adherents for drinking a sacramental tea containing a Schedule I controlled substance.  After the federal government seized its sacramental tea, the União do Vegetal (UDV), the New Mexican branch of a Brazilian church that imbibes ayahuasca in its services, sued, claiming the seizure was illegal, and sought to ensure future importation of the tea for religious use. The church won a preliminary injunction from the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, which was affirmed on appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed. The Court also disagreed with the government's central argument that the uniform application of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) does not allow for exceptions for the substance in this case, as Native Americans are given exceptions to use peyote, another Schedule I substance.\n\nBackground \nOn May 21, 1999, U. S. Customs agents seized over  of hoasca (ayahuasca) tea which was shipped to the Santa Fe, New Mexico branch of the Brazil-based UDV; ayahuasca contains dimethyltryptamine, which is outlawed for most purposes under the Controlled Substances Act. While no charges were filed, the United States chapter, led by Seagram heir Jeffrey Bronfman, filed suit claiming that the seizure was an illegal violation of the church members' rights. They claimed their usage was permitted under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), , a law passed by Congress in direct response to Employment Division v. Smith (1990), in which the Supreme Court held that unemployment benefits could be denied to two Native Americans fired for using Peyote.\n\nIn filing suit, the UDV sought a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from barring their usage of hoasca.  In August 2002, U.S. District Chief Judge James Aubrey Parker granted the church's motion, finding it was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim under RFRA.\n\nIn September 2003, United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit Senior Judge John Carbone Porfilio, joined by Judge Stephanie Kulp Seymour, affirmed, over the dissent of Judge Michael R. Murphy.  In November 2004, a divided majority of the en banc 10th Circuit again affirmed in a per curiam decision, by a vote of 8-5.  Judge Murphy, joined fully by Judges David M. Ebel, Paul Joseph Kelly Jr., and Terrence L. O'Brien, wrote separately to argue that the district court used the correct standard but should not have granted the preliminary injunction. Judge Seymour, joined by Judges Deanell Reece Tacha, Porfilio, Robert Harlan Henry, Mary Beck Briscoe, and Carlos F. Lucero, wrote separately to argue that the district court used the wrong standard but reached the correct result.  Judge Michael W. McConnell, joined in full by Judge Timothy Tymkovich, argued that the district court used the correct standard to reach the correct result, and partially joined those parts of the other opinions that said so.\n\nAs it worked its way through the appellate courts, the Supreme Court lifted a stay in December 2004 thereby permitting the church to use hoasca for their Christmas services.  One-hour of oral arguments were heard on November 1, 2005, where Edwin Kneedler, the Deputy Solicitor General of the United States, appeared for the government.\n\nOpinion of the Court \nOn February 21, 2006, the Supreme Court unanimously delivered judgment in favor of the church, affirming and remanding to the lower court.  Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court of eight justices. Justice Samuel Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of the case because he was not on the Court when the case was argued. The Court found that the government was unable to detail the government's compelling interest in barring religious usage of Hoasca when applying strict scrutiny as required by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n\nThe Court first found that the standard under RFRA for a preliminary injunction is the same as at trial, just as it would be for a constitutional claim.  Disagreeing with the District Court, the Supreme Court found that ayahuasca is covered under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, which is implemented by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The Court rejected the District Court's reliance on the official commentary to the convention, reasoning that the United Nations had incorrectly interpreted the treaty when it found that tea made from plants is a naturally occurring material.  However, because the government had failed to submit any evidence on the international consequences of granting an exemption to CSA enforcement by allowing UDV to practice its religion, the Court ruled that it had failed to meet its burden on this point. The Supreme Court ruled that the government failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV's sacramental use of the tea.",

Swadhin bangla betar kendra's formation was a result of the gallant initiative taken by three young individuals: dr. Syed anwar ali, engineer ashikul islam, and engineer dilip chandra das.\n\nOn 26th march 1971, the day after operation searchlight, a brutal crackdown by pakistani forces left the nation in despair. Amid this critical juncture, a message from sheikh mujibur rahman reached dr. Syed anwar ali through some students in chittagong. The message was translated to bengali by dr. Anwar ali's wife, dr. Manjula anwar.\n\nTo broadcast this message, they decided to cross the kalurghat bridge and reach the local transmission center controlled by the bengali soldiers of the 8th east bengal regiment under major ziaur rahman. With their effort, a voice was heard on the radio saying, \"swadhin bangla biplobi betar kendra theke ami major zia balchhi\". This broadcast boosted the nation's confidence and optimism.\n\nDr. Syed anwar ali, engineer ashikul islam, and engineer dilip chandra das started with a 10 kw transmitter. Throughout the liberation war, swadhin bangla betar kendra served as an organized front, airing patriotic songs, war news, and talk shows to uplift the spirits of the people. The station was successful in carrying out its intellectual war and became the voice of the bangladesh government in exile. \n\n<user> Why was east pakistan unhappy with west pakistan before the war? \n\n<assistant> Before the war, east pakistan (now bangladesh) was unhappy with west pakistan because it felt dominated and marginalized. Although both the zones were part of pakistan, they had vast cultural differences and were physically separated by over a thousand miles of indian territory. The western zone, which was more powerful and influential, had most of the control over resources and decision-making. As a result, east pakistan suffered from a lack of representation, economic negligence, and discrimination.\n\nThe continuous marginalization and discontent led to various issues such as the language movement in 1952, which was a protest against the imposition of urdu as the only official language. Over time, the dissatisfaction among the people of east pakistan grew, culminating in the civil disobedience movement, and eventually leading to the bangladesh liberation war in 1971, when they fought for their independence. \n\n<user> What was the role of Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra in mobilizing world opinion in favor of Bangladesh during the Liberation War? \n\n<assistant> Swadhin bangla betar kendra played a crucial role in mobilizing world opinion in favor of bangladesh during the liberation war by broadcasting updates about the war, highlighting the atrocities committed by pakistani forces, and promoting the bengali nationalists' cause. By reaching out to international audiences and media, the station helped create awareness and sympathy about the situation in bangladesh. This global attention eventually led to diplomatic pressure on pakistan from various countries and resulted in support, both morally and materially, for the cause of the bangladeshi people, ultimately aiding their struggle for independence.

        "reference": "Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra () was the radio broadcasting centre of Bengali nationalist forces during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. This station played a vital role in liberation struggle, broadcasting the Declaration of Independence and increasing the morale of Bangladeshis during the war. In 1971, radio was the only media reaching to the far ends of Bangladesh. It ran a propaganda campaign through the war. Mr Sufi barkat-e-khoda was one of the personalities of the show.\n\nBackground\n\nThe end of British rule in India in August 1947, accompanied by the Partition of India, gave birth to a new country named Pakistan which constituted Muslim-majority areas in the far east and far west of the Indian subcontinent. The Western zone was popularly (and for a period of time, also officially) termed West Pakistan and the Eastern zone (modern-day Bangladesh) was initially termed East Bengal and later, East Pakistan. The two zones were separated by over thousand miles of Indian territory in the middle, and had vastly different culture. It was widely perceived that the west zone dominated the country, leading to the effective marginalization of the east zone. Growing disenchantment among the people of East Pakistan finally led to civil disobedience followed by Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.\n\nDuring the period of Liberation War of Bangladesh, media supported mass sentiments. They aired patriotic songs and talk shows. In the process of achieving our independence by trouncing the atrocities of the Pakistani military forces, the war-time broadcasting station \"Shadheen Bangla Betar Kendra\" played a vital role- in increasing the mental state of the whole Bangali nation by informing us how well we are advancing towards the victory. Shadheen Bangla Betar Kendra reached its pinnacle during the liberation war being acclaimed as the stool pigeon of war news updates through 'Chorom Potro'. In those days when radio was the only media reaching to the far ends of Bangladesh, Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra eventually turned as the orator of the Bangladesh government in exile. It ran the nationalist campaign throughout the war in gearing up our freedom fighters moral and also mobilizing world opinion in favor of Bangladesh.\n\nFormation\nOn 26 March 1971, just the day after the Operation Searchlight crackdown, when the brutal mass carnage by the Pakistani invaders plunged the nation into gloom and despair, at that critical juncture of history a voice was heard over Radio saying \"Swadhin Bangla Biplobi Betar Kendra Theke Ami Major Zia Balchhi\". With that broadcast the entire nation got back its confidence, courage of conviction and strong optimism. It was all possible because of the galant initiative taken by three young individuals Dr. Syed Anwar Ali, Engineer Ashikul Islam and Engineer Dilip Chandra Das to start with 10 KW transmitter. Since then, during the whole period of Liberation War, Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra successfully carried out its intellectual war like an organized front and aired patriotic songs which greatly inspired the freedom fighters in their relentless fight against the Pakistan-led occupation forces, war news and talk shows to boost up people's spirits. \nIn the afternoon of 26 March 1971 a telegram containing the message of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman reached to one Syed Anwar Ali through some students in Chittagong. The message was translated to Bengali by Dr. Syed Anwar Ali's wife Dr. Manjula Anwar. She along with Syed Anwar Ali, Kazi Hosne Ara and two WAPDA engineers Mr. Ashikul Islam and Mr. Dilip Chandra Das in order to broadcast that message decided to cross over the Kalurghat Bridge to reach the local transmission centre controlled by the Bengali soldiers of the 8th East Bengal Regiment under Major Ziaur Rahman.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> What were the main ideas and goals of the frankfurt school, and why did they feel it was necessary? \n\n<assistant> The frankfurt school, a school of social theory and critical philosophy, was founded in response to the dissatisfaction with the socio-economic systems of capitalist, fascist, and communist societies during the interwar period in the 1930s. The theorists believed that existing social theory couldn't explain the turbulent political factionalism and reactionary politics occurring in 20th-century liberal capitalist societies.\n\nThe main ideas and goals of the frankfurt school revolved around developing a critical theory that went beyond the inflexibility of capitalism and marxism-leninism towards alternative paths for social development. To address the limitations of classical marxism and other 19th-century theories, they synthesized ideas from various sources like immanuel kant, georg wilhelm friedrich hegel, karl marx, sigmund freud, max weber, georg simmel, and georg lukács. They integrated the social sciences and drew upon antipositivist sociology, psychoanalysis, and existentialism.\n\nThe school was interested in the conditions that allowed for social change through rational social institutions, emphasizing the critical component of social theory. They aimed to overcome the ideological constraints of positivism, materialism, and determinism by returning to kant's critical philosophy and incorporating dialectic and contradiction from hegel's philosophy.\n\nSince the 1960s, jürgen habermas's work in communicative rationality, linguistic intersubjectivity, and \"the philosophical discourse of modernity\" has guided the critical-theory work of the institute for social research. However, certain critical theorists like raymond geuss and nikolas kompridis have opposed habermas's propositions, claiming that he undermined the original social-change purposes of critical theory. \n\n<user> How did the political events during the weimar republic and the rise of nazism have an impact on the development of critical theory in the frankfurt school? \n\n<assistant> The Frankfurt School and the development of critical theory were significantly influenced by the political events and social conditions in the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazism. The tumultuous interwar years between 1918 and 1939 featured continued political instability, which shaped the scholars' thinking and concerns. \n\nThe failed German Revolution of 1918-19, foreseen by Marx, exposed the shortcomings of existing Marxist theory in understanding and responding to the social and political dynamics during that period. The Frankfurt School took this as an urgent call to reassess and expand the understanding of Marxist theories in the context of evolving socio-political situations.\n\nThe rise of Nazism, a German form of fascism, was another manifestation of the turbulent politics in 20th-century German society. The stark contrast it presented to other socio-economic systems and its rapid ascent to power challenged established social theories, highlighting the need to develop a novel approach capable of critiquing and understanding such phenomena. As a result, the Frankfurt School scholars focused on creating a critical theory that addressed the inadequacies of traditional social theories and sought alternative paths to social development that could better respond to the complex political realities of the 20th century. \n\n<user> Can you explain more about jürgen habermas's work guiding the critical-theory work of the institute for social research, and what are the main criticisms made by raymond geuss and nikolas kompridis? \n\n<assistant> Jürgen habermas is a prominent german philosopher and sociologist, deeply associated with the frankfurt school. His work has focused on communicative rationality, linguistic intersubjectivity, and \"the philosophical discourse of modernity.\" habermas expanded the scope of the school's critical theory by integrating insights about language, communication, and public sphere, articulating the importance of democratic deliberation and highlighting the role of communication in forming the rational basis for social consensus.\n\nRaymond geuss and nikolas kompridis, however, have critiqued habermas's approach, arguing that it weakens the original goals of critical theory. They believe that habermas's emphasis on communication and consensus sidelines other important aspects of critical theory, such as the exploration of potentially emancipatory social and political alternatives.\n\nGeuss argues that habermas's work discounts the critical potential of other forms of discourse or normative challenges, suggesting that habermas's theoretical framework might, in some cases, suppress dissenting or radical perspectives instead of promoting emancipation. Kompridis, on the other hand, contends that habermas's approach is too focused on procedural aspects of rationality and communication, which makes it politically and conceptually conservative. This, according to kompridis, hinders the possibility for transformative social change in the way that the original critical theory intended. \n\n<user> How did max horkheimer contribute to the frankfurt school, and what kind of intellectuals did he recruit once he became the director? \n\n<assistant> Max horkheimer was a german philosopher and sociologist who played a pivotal role in the development of the frankfurt school by becoming its director in 1930. Horkheimer was instrumental in shaping the school's interdisciplinary approach, emphasizing the integration of social sciences in their critical theory.\n\nUnder horkheimer's leadership, the frankfurt school aimed to create a synthesis of marxian and freudian perspectives to challenge both economic and psychological determinism. He was interested in analyzing the underlying social and psychological causes of political and economic crises and exploring the feasibility of radical social change.\n\nHorkheimer recruited a diverse range of talented intellectuals from various fields to contribute to the school's pursuit of a comprehensive critical theory. Some of the prominent figures he brought on board included:\n\n1. Theodor w. Adorno - a philosopher, sociologist, and musicologist, adorno contributed significantly to critical theory, aesthetics, and sociology.\n2. Erich fromm - a psychoanalyst specializing in the intersection of psychology and society, fromm explored the deep psychological impact of social and institutional forces on individuals.\n3. Herbert marcuse - a philosopher who intertwined social and political philosophy, marcuse contributed to the critique of advanced industrial societies and delineated the prospects for social change.\n\nHorkheimer's vision and recruitment of these diverse thinkers helped solidify the frankfurt school's identity as a multi-disciplinary intellectual hub focused on advancing a comprehensive approach to social critique and change.

        "reference": "The Frankfurt School () was a school of social theory and critical philosophy associated with the Institute for Social Research, at Goethe University Frankfurt in 1929. Founded in the Weimar Republic (1918–1933), during the European interwar period (1918–1939), the Frankfurt School comprised intellectuals, academics, and political dissidents dissatisfied with the contemporary socio-economic systems (capitalist, fascist, communist) of the 1930s. The Frankfurt theorists proposed that social theory was inadequate for explaining the turbulent political factionalism and reactionary politics occurring in 20th century liberal capitalist societies. Critical of both capitalism and of Marxism–Leninism as philosophically inflexible systems of social organization, the School's critical theory research indicated alternative paths to realizing the social development of a society and a nation.\n\nThe Frankfurt School perspective of critical investigation (open-ended and self-critical) is based upon Freudian, Marxist and Hegelian premises of idealist philosophy. To fill the omissions of 19th-century classical Marxism, which did not address 20th-century social problems, they applied the methods of antipositivist sociology, of psychoanalysis, and of existentialism. The School's sociologic works derived from syntheses of the thematically pertinent works of Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and Karl Marx, of Sigmund Freud and Max Weber, and of Georg Simmel and Georg Lukács.\n\nLike Karl Marx, the Frankfurt School concerned themselves with the conditions (political, economic, societal) that allow for social change realized by way of rational social institutions. Their emphasis on the critical component of social theory derived from their attempts to overcome the ideological limitations of positivism, materialism, and determinism by returning to the critical philosophy of Kant and his successors in German idealism – principally the philosophy of Hegel, which emphasized dialectic and contradiction as intellectual properties inherent to the human grasp of material reality.\n\nSince the 1960s, the critical-theory work of the Institute for Social Research has been guided by Jürgen Habermas's work in communicative rationality, linguistic intersubjectivity, and \"the philosophical discourse of modernity.\" Critical theorists Raymond Geuss and Nikolas Kompridis have opposed Habermas's propositions, claiming he has undermined the original social-change purposes of critical-theory-problems, such as what should reason mean; analysis of the conditions necessary to realize social emancipation; and critiques of contemporary capitalism.\n\nHistory\n\nInstitute for Social Research\n\nThe term \"Frankfurt School\" describes the works of scholarship and the intellectuals who were the Institute for Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung), an adjunct organization at Goethe University Frankfurt, founded in 1923, by Carl Grünberg, a Marxist professor of law at the University of Vienna. It was the first Marxist research center at a German university and was funded through the largesse of the wealthy student Felix Weil (1898–1975).\n\nWeil's doctoral dissertation dealt with the practical problems of implementing socialism. In 1922, he organized the First Marxist Workweek  (Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche) in effort to synthesize different trends of Marxism into a coherent, practical philosophy; the first symposium included György Lukács, Karl Korsch, Karl August Wittfogel and Friedrich Pollock. The success of the First Marxist Workweek prompted the formal establishment of a permanent institute for social research, and Weil negotiated with the Ministry of Education for a university professor to be director of the Institute for Social Research, thereby, formally ensuring that the Frankfurt School would be a university institution.\n\nKorsch and Lukács participated in the Arbeitswoche, which included the study of Marxism and Philosophy (1923), by Karl Korsch, but their Communist Party membership precluded their active participation in the Institute for Social Research (Frankfurt School); yet Korsch participated in the School's publishing venture. Moreover, the political correctness by which the Communists compelled Lukács to repudiate his book History and Class Consciousness (1923) indicated that political, ideological, and intellectual independence from the communist party was a necessary work condition for realizing the production of knowledge.\n\nThe philosophical tradition of the Frankfurt School – the multi-disciplinary integration of the social sciences – is associated with the philosopher Max Horkheimer, who became the director in 1930, and recruited intellectuals such as Theodor W. Adorno (philosopher, sociologist, musicologist), Erich Fromm (psychoanalyst), and Herbert Marcuse (philosopher).\n\nEuropean interwar period (1918–39)\nIn the Weimar Republic (1918–33), the continual political turmoils of the interwar years (1918–39) much affected the development of the critical theory philosophy of the Frankfurt School. The scholars were especially influenced by the Communists’ failed German Revolution of 1918–19 (which Marx predicted) and by the rise of Nazism (1933–45), a German form of fascism.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> How do negative verbs function in english and differ across some uralic languages like finnish, estonian, and hungarian? \n\n<assistant> In english, a standard negation (sn) is used to negate declarative main clauses. The verbal negation predicate is \"not.\" negation is often formed by combining the auxiliary \"do\" with the negative verb. The auxiliary \"do\" indicates whether one or multiple individuals are involved, while the main verb referring to the negated activity remains non-inflected.\n\nIn contrast, uralic languages like finnish, estonian, and hungarian have different uses of negation predicates with specific similarities. Finnish employs a standard negation (sn) that is realized by a verbal complex made up of a non-finite main verb followed by the negative auxiliary bearing person and number information. The marker for tense depends on the clausal context and only appears on the main verb in the form of a connegative or past participle.\n\nEstonian uses a particle-like, non-inflectional negative auxiliary \"ei,\" positioned pre-verbally. Estonian also forms a connegative in the present tense or active past participle. Unlike other uralic languages, the negative auxiliary in estonian doesn't need to be inflectional.\n\nHungarian employs a negation particle \"nem\" for most cases. In the jussive/imperative (j-mood), this particle changes to \"ne.\" the copular verb \"lenni\" in the 3rd person present indicative has unique negative forms, \"nincs(en)\" and \"nincsenek,\" instead of the regular \"nem van\" and \"nem vannak.\" these forms are used in existential statements and don't appear when the copular verb is not used, implying the verb's presence by their absence.\n\nOverall, the use of negative verbs in english is simpler than in uralic languages, with the latter exhibiting more complex structures and various forms depending on tense, mood, and context. \n\n<user> Can you explain how negation works in Inari Sami, Northern Sami, and Lule Sami languages? I'm interested in how they conjugate negative verbs in different moods and personal forms. \n\n<assistant> Sure! Inari sami, northern sami, and lule sami languages all involve the conjugation of negative verbs in moods and personal forms. \n\nIn inari sami, the negative verb is conjugated according to mood and personal forms. The process for conjugating negative verbs involves indicative, conditional, and potential moods. For the imperative mood, particular forms and strategies are used.\n\nNorthern sami, similar to inari sami, also conjugates the negative verb in moods and personal forms. In the case of indicative, conditional, and potential moods, distinctive strategies are used for conjugation. The imperative mood also has specific forms and processes.\n\nLule sami shares the feature of conjugating negative verbs in moods and personal forms. For indicative, conditional, and potential moods, the language offers unique approaches to conjugation. As in the other languages mentioned, the imperative mood in lule sami involves distinct forms and techniques for conjugation.\n\nOverall, these three sami languages, though different in specific conjugation strategies, all conjugate negative verbs according to mood and personal forms. This makes them slightly more complex than languages like english or hungarian when dealing with negations, as they involve unique processes and structures that vary across moods and forms. \n\n<user> How we say something isn't true in finnish? what is the negative thingy that you said? \n\n<assistant> In finnish, to say something isn't true, you use a special word called a negative auxiliary. The root of this word is \"e-.\" when you want to say something negative, you first have your main verb, which is in a non-finite form. Then, you add the negative auxiliary that tells us who is doing the action and how many people. The tricky part is that the tense (like present or past) is marked on the main verb, not on the negative auxiliary. So, it may look a bit different than what you're used to in english! \n\n<user> That's fascinating! can you give me an example of a negative sentence in finnish and explain how the negation works in that sentence? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Let's take the example of a negative sentence in finnish: \"minä en syö\" which translates to \"i don't eat\" in english.\n\nIn this sentence, \"minä\" means \"i,\" \"en\" is the negative auxiliary, and \"syö\" is the non-finite form of the verb \"to eat.\" let's break down the negation:\n\n1. \"minä\" is the subject, \"i.\"\n2. \"en\" is the negative auxiliary, indicating negation, i.e., \"do not\" or \"don't\" in english. The auxiliary shows it's the first person (i or me).\n3. \"syö\" is the non-finite main verb meaning \"to eat.\" it lacks the usual personal ending because it's in a connegative form.\n\nThe sentence is structured as follows: subject (minä) + negative auxiliary (en) + non-finite main verb (syö). The negation is formed by the negative auxiliary \"en,\" which shows it's in the first person, while the main verb remains in its non-finite form (syö), without a personal ending.\n\nThis structure differs from english, where the auxiliary \"do\" is combined with the negative verb \"not\" (don't), and the main verb remains uninflected (\"eat\" stays the same).

        "reference": "Dryer  defined three different types of negative markers in language. Beside negative particles and negative affixes, negative verbs play a role in various languages. The negative verb is used to implement a clausal negation. The negative predicate counts as a semantic function and is localized and therefore grammaticalized in different languages. Negation verbs are often used as an auxiliary type which also carries φ-feature content. This could be visualized for example in the inflectional character of the negation verb while combined with the main verb. This is some sort of tendency by Dryer to place the negation verb before the finite verb. Miestamo researched four different types of negations and proposed a distinction between symmetric negation in which a negative marker is added and asymmetric negation in which beside the added negation marker, other structural changes appear.\n\nEnglish\nIn English a standard negation (SN) is used to negate declarative main clauses. The verbal negation predicate is 'not'. To negate other clauses, the negation construction differs from SN. The English auxiliary 'do' performs in combination with the negative verb that indicates whether one or multiple individuals are involved while the verb referring to the negated activity remains non-inflected. Concluding this, ordinary verbs take the auxiliary do when negated by not.\n\nUralic languages\nUralic languages differ in the use of negation predicates from each other but show specific similarities. For defining different patterns of negation predicates it is necessary to know about the lexical verb (LV) and the finite form (FE). Miestamo defined four types of asymmetry in negation verbs. The first type shows a prominent appearance in Uralic languages. It is defined as A/Fin (A = asymmetry | Fin = finiteness) and describes that influenced by the negation verb, the finiteness of the LV is reduced or lost. For example, the LV loses the finiteness because the clause is marked by the de-verbalizing negative morphem. Therefore, the copula is added as a type which holds the finite status (FE). In some uralic languages speaker produce connegatives to construct the syntactically acceptable word form used in negative clauses.\n\nFinnish \nThe standard negation (SN) in Finnish language is realized by a verbal complex. First the LV with a non-finite character is formed followed by the finite element which is presented as the negative auxiliary. The root of the auxiliary is 'e-'. The ending gives information about person and number. The marker for tense is not presented on the auxiliary and is only dependent from the clausal context. Therefore, tense is marked on the LV separated from the auxiliary and appears as connegative form in present tense and past participle in past tense.\n\nNegative Verb - Overview for clausal negations \n\nIndicative, conditional, and potential\n\nImperative\n\nEstonian\nThe Estonian language uses a particle-like non-inflectional negative auxiliary which is hierarchical presented on a pre-verbal slot. The auxiliary is realized as 'ei'. A special form differs from the SN while forming the connegative in the present tense, in the past form or the active past participle. Differing to other Uralic languages, in Estonian language the flectional character doesn't seem to be a necessary feature for the negative auxiliary. This is important because the question appears, if the auxiliary has to show a flectional marker even if the LV is not showing any flectional marker without using the negation modus.\n\nNegative Verb - Strategies in clausal negations \n\nIndicative, conditional, and oblique\n\nImperative\n\nSkolt Saami \nIn Skolt Saami the SN shows a negative auxiliary compared with a non-finite LV. For imperative a special case is provided.\n\nNegative Verb - Summary\n\nSouth Saami \nIn South Saami the SN is realized by a negative auxiliary. This form is used in present tense and the preterite. The LV is presented as a connegative form. A special case is presented while creating the imperative. In this case the negative auxiliary gets a full personal paradigm except for the third person 'dual'. The third person in singular in present tense of the negative auxiliary is prohibited as a negative reply.\n\nNegative Verb - Strategies in clausal negations\n\nInari Sami\nThe negative verb is conjugated in moods and personal forms in Inari Sami.\n\nIndicative, conditional, and potential mood\n\nImperative\n\nNorthern Sami\nThe negative verb is conjugated in moods and personal forms in Northern Sami.\n\nIndicative, conditional, and potential mood\n\nImperative\n\nLule Sami\nThe negative verb is conjugated in moods and personal forms in Lule Sami.\n\nIndicative, conditional, and potential mood\n\nHungarian \nHungarian has lost most evidence of a negative verb, but the negation particle 'nem' becomes 'ne' before verbs in the jussive/imperative (also sometimes called the conditional mood, or J-mood). Furthermore, the 3rd person present indicative of the copular verb ('lenni') has unique negative forms 'nincs(en)' and 'nincsenek' as opposed to 'nem van' and 'nem vannak', but only when the particle and verb would occur adjacently. In all other instances the copular verb acts regularly. These forms are also unique in that they have an existential role \"there is (not)\" and \"there are (not)\". In the present indicative 3rd person, copular verbs are not used; rather the absence of a verb (with or without a negation particle) implies the copula.\n\nKomi\nIn Komi language, the negative marker and the form of the negative construction is dependent of the clausal tense. If the corresponding affirmative predicate is based in a verbal form, a negative auxiliary is used. This is not convertible for affirmative verbs with nominal forms. The negative auxiliary is used in present tense, future tense, 1st past tense of indicative and in the imperative and optative mood.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Hi there! i've been exploring the world of discrete geometry and i'm fascinated by all the different topics within the field. i'd like to understand more about polyhedra and polytopes, especially regarding lattice polytopes and ehrhart polynomials. it would be great to get more insights on how they work and their applications. additionally, i'm intrigued by the idea of packing and coverings, such as sphere packings and the kepler conjecture. can you help to explain these concepts and give examples? \n\n<assistant> Of course! I'd be happy to help you understand these concepts better. \n\nPolyhedra and polytopes are geometric objects with flat sides that exist in any number of dimensions. A polygon is a polytope in two dimensions, while a polyhedron is a polytope in three dimensions. The study of polyhedra and polytopes is part of discrete geometry.\n\nLattice polytopes are polytopes whose vertices have integer coordinates. They play a prominent role in various mathematical disciplines, such as combinatorics, optimization, and number theory. \n\nEhrhart polynomials are named after the mathematician eugène ehrhart. They pertain to counting the number of integer points in a dilated lattice polytope. Ehrhart polynomials are useful in discrete geometry, computational geometry, and algebraic geometry. \n\nNow let's discuss packings and coverings. In discrete geometry, packings, coverings, and tilings are methods for arranging uniform objects, like circles or spheres, regularly on a surface or manifold. \n\nA sphere packing is an arrangement of non-overlapping spheres within a containing space, usually three-dimensional euclidean space. The spheres are typically all of identical size. Sphere packing problems can be generalized to include unequal spheres and n-dimensional euclidean spaces, such as circle packings in two dimensions or hypersphere packings in higher dimensions.\n\nThe kepler conjecture is a statement concerning sphere packing in three-dimensional euclidean space. It states that the densest possible arrangement of equal-sized spheres is achieved by a stacking pattern called the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice. In this arrangement, each sphere is surrounded by 12 equidistant neighbors, and the spheres fill approximately 74.05% of the space, leaving the rest as empty space or gaps.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification on any topic. \n\n<user> Thanks for the insight! i was also reading about structural rigidity and flexibility, and i came across something called cauchy's theorem and flexible polyhedra. could you provide a simple explanation of these concepts? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Structural rigidity and flexibility are concepts from the field of discrete geometry that deal with predicting the flexibility of structures created by connecting rigid bodies with flexible linkages or hinges.\n\nCauchy's theorem is a fundamental result in the study of the rigidity of polyhedra. This theorem states that if you have two convex polyhedra with the same number of faces, edges, and vertices, as well as matching face angles, then these polyhedra are congruent, meaning they can be transformed into each other through translations and rotations. This limits the possible deformations of convex polyhedra, making them structurally rigid.\n\nNow, let's talk about flexible polyhedra. A flexible polyhedron is essentially a polyhedron that can be continuously deformed without altering the shape of its faces or the connectivity of its vertices and edges. It means that such a polyhedron can change its structure while keeping its combinatorial and geometric properties intact. Most polyhedra are rigid, but there are some notable examples of flexible polyhedra, such as the bricard octahedron and the connelly sphere.\n\nThe bricard octahedron is a self-intersecting octahedron that can undergo continuous deformation while maintaining its edge lengths and topology. The connelly sphere, discovered by robert connelly in 1977, is a flexible polyhedron with 31 vertices and 50 triangular faces that can undergo infinitesimal flexing. It's the first known example of a flexible polyhedron with triangular faces, and it has helped researchers better understand the conditions under which a polyhedron can be flexible.\n\nIn summary, cauchy's theorem helps describe the rigidity of convex polyhedra, while flexible polyhedra are rare cases of polyhedra that can bend and twist without changing their faces or connectivity. Studying structural rigidity and flexibility helps mathematicians and engineers understand the properties of various structures, which can be valuable in designing efficient and stable constructions or devices.\n\nI hope this child-friendly explanation helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! \n\n<user> Yo, that was mad cool! another thing i'm curious about is geometric graph theory. i read about graph drawing and voronoi diagrams, but i haven't really grasped it yet. can you break it down for me and explain what they mean and how they're used in real life? \n\n<assistant> Sure thing! Geometric graph theory is a field that studies graphs associated with geometric objects, like points, lines, and shapes. It combines graph theory and geometry to analyze networks and relationships in various contexts.\n\nGraph drawing is the process of visualizing graphs or networks, which consist of nodes (or vertices) and edges connecting them. A good drawing can help identify patterns and extract information from complex data. In real-life applications, graph drawing can be used to visualize social networks, transportation networks, and even protein interactions in biology, to name just a few examples.\n\nVoronoi diagrams are a way of dividing a plane into regions based on the distance to a set of points, known as seeds or generators. In a voronoi diagram, each region consists of all points closer to one generator than any other. To give you a real-life example, imagine you have several pizza delivery locations in a city. A voronoi diagram can help find which delivery location is closest to a given customer by dividing the city into regions where each region represents the area that is closest to one specific pizza location.\n\nVoronoi diagrams have uses in many areas, including computer graphics, robotics, geography, and optimization. For instance, they can be employed to optimize cell phone tower placement, analyze spatial distributions of species in ecology, or even understand how particles interact in physics.\n\nIn summary, geometric graph theory is a hybrid field that studies graphs with a geometric context. Graph drawing is about visualizing these graphs, which assists in understanding complex networks, while voronoi diagrams help analyze proximity relationships by partitioning space into regions closest to specific points. These concepts have many real-life applications, enabling us to tackle challenging problems in various disciplines.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions if something's unclear or you want to learn about other topics! \n\n<user> Wow, I'm really starting to appreciate the vast array of concepts within discrete geometry! One last topic that caught my eye was digital geometry. The idea of converting objects into discrete sets of points is interesting. Could you give me a brief overview of digital geometry and some of its main applications? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Digital geometry is a branch of geometry that deals with discrete sets, usually considered as digitized models or images of objects in two- or three-dimensional euclidean space. It focuses on the representation, analysis, and manipulation of digital images and geometric shapes.\n\nDigitizing is the process of converting an object into a discrete set of points, similar to how the images we see on a tv screen, computer monitor, or in newspapers are actually digital images composed of a grid of pixels. Each pixel on this grid represents a small portion of the overall image.\n\nDigital geometry has numerous applications, particularly in the areas of computer graphics and image analysis. In computer graphics, digitization is essential for rendering complex shapes and models on a screen, allowing designers to produce realistic animations and visualizations. In image analysis, digital geometry can be applied to process and study images, including tasks like edge detection, pattern recognition, and shape extraction.\n\nSome specific techniques used in digital geometry include morphological operations (e.g., erosion, dilation), connected component labeling, skeletonization, and distance transforms. These methods can help identify features, analyze shapes, and perform various other operations on digital images and models.\n\nTo sum up, digital geometry is a fascinating field that revolves around working with discrete sets of points to represent and analyze complex objects in the digital world. Its applications span numerous areas, including computer graphics, image analysis, and even geographic information systems (gis).\n\nI hope this gives you an overview of digital geometry! If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask. ",

        "reference": "Discrete geometry and combinatorial geometry are branches of geometry that study combinatorial properties and constructive methods of discrete geometric objects.  Most questions in discrete geometry involve finite or discrete sets of basic geometric objects, such as points, lines, planes, circles, spheres, polygons, and so forth.  The subject focuses on the combinatorial properties of these objects, such as how they intersect one another, or how they may be arranged to cover a larger object.\n\nDiscrete geometry has a large overlap with convex geometry and computational geometry, and is closely related to subjects such as finite geometry, combinatorial optimization, digital geometry, discrete differential geometry, geometric graph theory, toric geometry, and combinatorial topology.\n\nHistory\nAlthough polyhedra and tessellations had been studied for many years by people such as Kepler and Cauchy, modern discrete geometry has its origins in the late 19th century.  Early topics studied were: the density of circle packings by Thue, projective configurations by Reye and Steinitz, the geometry of numbers by Minkowski, and map colourings by Tait, Heawood, and Hadwiger.\n\nLászló Fejes Tóth, H.S.M. Coxeter and Paul Erdős, laid the foundations of discrete geometry.\n\nTopics\n\nPolyhedra and polytopes\n\nA polytope is a geometric object with flat sides, which exists in any general number of dimensions. A polygon is a polytope in two dimensions, a polyhedron in three dimensions, and so on in higher dimensions (such as a 4-polytope in four dimensions). Some theories further generalize the idea to include such objects as unbounded polytopes (apeirotopes and tessellations), and abstract polytopes.\n\nThe following are some of the aspects of polytopes studied in discrete geometry:\nPolyhedral combinatorics\nLattice polytopes\nEhrhart polynomials\nPick's theorem\nHirsch conjecture\n\nPackings, coverings and tilings\n\nPackings, coverings, and tilings are all ways of arranging uniform objects (typically circles, spheres, or tiles) in a regular way on a surface or manifold.\n\nA sphere packing is an arrangement of non-overlapping spheres within a containing space. The spheres considered are usually all of identical size, and the space is usually three-dimensional Euclidean space. However, sphere packing problems can be generalised to consider unequal spheres, n-dimensional Euclidean space (where the problem becomes circle packing in two dimensions, or hypersphere packing in higher dimensions) or to non-Euclidean spaces such as hyperbolic space.\n\nA tessellation of a flat surface is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In mathematics, tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions.\n\nSpecific topics in this area include:\nCircle packings\nSphere packings\nKepler conjecture\nQuasicrystals\nAperiodic tilings\nPeriodic graph\nFinite subdivision rules\n\nStructural rigidity and flexibility\n\nStructural rigidity is a combinatorial theory for predicting the flexibility of ensembles formed by rigid bodies connected by flexible linkages or hinges.\n\nTopics in this area include:\nCauchy's theorem\nFlexible polyhedra\n\nIncidence structures\n\nIncidence structures generalize planes (such as affine, projective, and Möbius planes) as can be seen from their axiomatic definitions. Incidence structures also generalize the higher-dimensional analogs and the finite structures are sometimes called finite geometries.\n\nFormally, an incidence structure is a triple\n\nwhere P is a set of \"points\", L is a set of \"lines\" and  is the incidence relation. The elements of  are called flags. If\n\nwe say that point p \"lies on\" line .\n\nTopics in this area include:\nConfigurations\nLine arrangements\nHyperplane arrangements\nBuildings\n\nOriented matroids\n\nAn oriented matroid is a mathematical structure that abstracts the properties of directed graphs and of arrangements of vectors in a vector space over an ordered field (particularly for partially ordered vector spaces). In comparison, an ordinary (i.e., non-oriented) matroid abstracts the dependence properties that are common both to graphs, which are not necessarily directed, and to arrangements of vectors over fields, which are not necessarily ordered.\n\nGeometric graph theory\n\nA geometric graph is a graph in which the vertices or edges are associated with geometric objects. Examples include Euclidean graphs, the 1-skeleton of a polyhedron or polytope, unit disk graphs, and visibility graphs.\n\nTopics in this area include:\nGraph drawing\nPolyhedral graphs\nRandom geometric graphs\nVoronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations\n\nSimplicial complexes\n\nA simplicial complex is a topological space of a certain kind, constructed by \"gluing together\" points, line segments, triangles, and their n-dimensional counterparts (see illustration).  Simplicial complexes should not be confused with the more abstract notion of a simplicial set appearing in modern simplicial homotopy theory.  The purely combinatorial counterpart to a simplicial complex is an abstract simplicial complex. See also random geometric complexes.\n\nTopological combinatorics\n\nThe discipline of combinatorial topology used combinatorial concepts in topology and in the early 20th century this turned into the field of algebraic topology.\n\nIn 1978, the situation was reversed – methods from algebraic topology were used to solve a problem in combinatorics – when László Lovász proved the Kneser conjecture, thus beginning the new study of topological combinatorics. Lovász's proof used the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and this theorem retains a prominent role in this new field. This theorem has many equivalent versions and analogs and has been used in the study of fair division problems.\n\nTopics in this area include:\nSperner's lemma\nRegular maps\n\nLattices and discrete groups\n\nA discrete group is a group G equipped with the discrete topology. With this topology, G becomes a topological group. A discrete subgroup of a topological group G is a subgroup H whose relative topology is the discrete one. For example, the integers, Z, form a discrete subgroup of the reals, R (with the standard metric topology), but the rational numbers, Q, do not.\n\nA lattice in a locally compact topological group is a discrete subgroup with the property that the quotient space has finite invariant measure. In the special case of subgroups of Rn, this amounts to the usual geometric notion of a lattice, and both the algebraic structure of lattices and the geometry of the totality of all lattices are relatively well understood. Deep results of Borel, Harish-Chandra, Mostow, Tamagawa, M. S. Raghunathan, Margulis, Zimmer obtained from the 1950s through the 1970s provided examples and generalized much of the theory to the setting of nilpotent Lie groups and semisimple algebraic groups over a local field. In the 1990s, Bass and Lubotzky initiated the study of tree lattices, which remains an active research area.\n\nTopics in this area include:\nReflection groups\nTriangle groups\n\nDigital geometry\n\nDigital geometry deals with discrete sets (usually discrete point sets) considered to be digitized models or images of objects of the 2D or 3D Euclidean space.\n\nSimply put, digitizing is replacing an object by a discrete set of its points. The images we see on the TV screen, the raster display of a computer, or in newspapers are in fact digital images.\n\nIts main application areas are computer graphics and image analysis.\n\nDiscrete differential geometry\n\nDiscrete differential geometry is the study of discrete counterparts of notions in differential geometry. Instead of smooth curves and surfaces, there are polygons, meshes, and simplicial complexes. It is used in the study of computer graphics and topological combinatorics.",

This means they have to dial both the area code and the local number, even for local calls. Adjusting to this change might take some time, but it ensures a more systematic way of assigning numbers and helps accommodate the increasing demand for phone numbers in the region without major disruptions to the existing users.

The existing area code, 215, could no longer accommodate the increasing number of telephone users. Later, area code 484 was added as an overlay because the region experienced more growth, and there was a significant increase in cell phone and pager usage, which caused a higher demand for phone numbers. \n\n<user> I've understood the historical aspect, but are there any significant differences for the residents when it comes to using these area codes in their day-to-day life? how does the introduction of a new area code impact them? \n\n<assistant> When a new area code is introduced, such as the 484 overlay for the 610 region, residents need to adapt to mandatory ten-digit dialing. This means they have to dial both the area code and the local number, even for local calls. Adjusting to this change might take some time, but it ensures a more systematic way of assigning numbers and helps accommodate the increasing demand for phone numbers in the region without major disruptions to the existing users.

        "reference": "Area codes 610 and 484 are telephone area codes which serve the eastern and southeastern regions of Pennsylvania. The area includes areas to the west of Philadelphia, along with the cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, and Reading. It includes much of the Delaware Valley, including almost all of Delaware County and most of the Philadelphia Main Line.\n\nHistory\nArea code 610 was created on January 8, 1994 as a split from numbering plan area 215, which had been the entire southeast quadrant of Pennsylvania since 1947. Permissive dialing of both 215 and 610  continued until the morning of January 7, 1995. It was Pennsylvania's first new area code since the implementation of the area code system in 1947.\n\nThree exchanges which would have switched to 610 were instead switched to 717, the area code for most of the eastern half of the state outside of the lower Delaware and Lehigh Valleys.  They were 267 at Denver, 445 at Terre Hill, and 484 at Adamstown, with 267 being replaced with 717-336 because 717-267 was already in use at Chambersburg.  These exchanges were all served by non-Bell telephone companies which sought to consolidate their eastern Pennsylvania customers into one area code, and would have had to change area codes anyway.\n\nThis was intended as a long-term solution, but further growth in the region over the subsequent five years, and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers, spurred the introduction of area code 484 as an overlay for the 610 region on June 5, 1999, along with the introduction of mandatory ten-digit dialing.\n\nArea code 835 was intended as an additional overlay code for the 610 and 484 numbering plan area, as announced by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in May 2000 and to be implemented in 2001. However, newly developed, more efficient number pooling measures were introduced instead, eliminating the immediate need for the new area code. The Commission formally withdrew plans for the new code on June 23, 2005, although the code remains reserved for later use within the Commonwealth if necessary. Under the most recent projections, the region will need another area code by the summer of 2024.\n\nArea code 835 was finally approved by the Public Utility Commission in a unanimous vote on December 2, 2021. Numbers in the new 835 Area Code will become available for assignment on September 20, 2022.",

General relativity: christoffel symbols are used in the mathematics behind the theory of general relativity, which describes the fundamental force of gravity. Through the calculation of the curvature of spacetime, scientists can understand gravitational phenomena around massive objects, like black holes and the formation of the universe.\n\n2. Geodesy: in the field of geodesy, which deals with the measurement and representation of earth, christoffel symbols provide valuable insights into the curvature of our planet and help in determining earth's gravitational field.\n\n3. Satellite orbits and gps systems: the equations governing satellite orbits and gps positioning systems are derived from the concept of geodesics. Geodesic equations involve the christoffel symbols, which describe how coordinates change in curved spacetime. Understanding these changes is essential for accurate satellite positioning and navigation systems.\n\n4. Cosmology: in the study of the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe, christoffel symbols are used to analyze the geometry of the cosmos and inform modern cosmological models.\n\nThese applications demonstrate the importance of christoffel symbols in various fields, acting as a bridge between mathematical concepts and real-world phenomena. Their connection with general relativity and physics allows for a deeper understanding of the universe and its underlying structure. <end_chat> \n\n<user> How does the calculation of christoffel symbols relate to the metrics of a manifold, and why is it important to work with the levi-civita connection? \n\n<assistant> Imagine you're walking on earth's bumpy surface, which can be thought of as a manifold. It has hills, valleys, and sometimes flat areas. The earth's surface's \"bumpiness\" can be described using the metric, which is a mathematical way of saying how distances are measured.\n\nNow, imagine you have a skateboard, and you want to know which way it'll naturally roll without you pushing it. This path depends on the bumpiness, or the metric, of earth's surface. The christoffel symbols give us a way to understand this natural path, called geodesic, by showing how the surface's \"bumpiness\" influences it.\n\nThe levi-civita connection is a particular connection that is special because it doesn't have any twist or torsion. You can think of torsion like a spiral staircase – if you walk in a straight line up or down, you'll end up twisting around. In many problems, especially in general relativity and physics, working with a connection without twists makes the math easier and gives more insights. And because the levi-civita connection is naturally tied to the metric, it is the perfect way to study motion and geometry of a curved surface or even spacetime! We use the christoffel symbols to represent this levi-civita connection and learn more about the manifold's shape and motion on it. <end_chat> \n\n<user> How are the christoffel symbols of the first kind different from the ones of the second kind? \n\n<assistant> Great question! The christoffel symbols come in two flavors: the first kind and the second kind. Both types allow us to study how the curvature of a manifold affects the changes in the coordinate system. However, they differ in the way they represent these changes.\n\nThe christoffel symbols of the first kind have three indices written with one upper and two lower indices, like this: {i, j, k}. Their primary purpose is to help keep track of how the basis vectors on the manifold change as you move from one point to another.\n\nOn the other hand, the christoffel symbols of the second kind have one upper and two lower indices, like this: γᵢⱼᵏ. They describe the same changes in coordinates as the first kind, but they use a different basis (the dual basis) for their representation. These symbols are more commonly used in calculations because their form makes computations, such as finding geodesics, much easier.\n\nIn summary, both the christoffel symbols of the first kind and the second kind help us understand how the geometry of a manifold impacts its coordinate system. The main difference between them is the choice of basis used, with symbols of the first kind using the original basis and symbols of the second kind using the dual basis. <end_chat> \n\n<user> How can i compute the christoffel symbols for a given metric tensor, and what role do the partial derivatives play in this process? \n\n<assistant> To compute the christoffel symbols for a given metric tensor, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the inverse metric tensor: calculate the inverse of the given metric tensor, denoted by g^(ij). You need the inverse metric to raise indices in the computations.\n \n2. Compute the partial derivatives of the metric tensor: calculate the first-order partial derivatives of each component of the given metric tensor with respect to the coordinates, denoted by ∂gₖₗ/∂xᵢ.\n\n3. Calculate the christoffel symbols of the second kind: use the following formula to compute γᵢⱼᵏ:\n\nΓᵢⱼᵏ = 1/2 * g^(ik) * (∂gₖⱼ/∂xᵢ + ∂gₖᵢ/∂xⱼ - ∂gᵢⱼ/∂xₖ)\n\nHere, the partial derivatives of the metric tensor components play a crucial role by describing the changes in the metric with respect to the coordinates. These derivatives connect the geometry of the manifold to the christoffel symbols.\n\n4. (optional) calculate the christoffel symbols of the first kind: if required, the first-kind symbols can be obtained by index lowering using the metric tensor. You can use the formula {i, j, k} = gᵢₗ * γⱼₖᵅ, where gᵢₗ is the metric tensor.\n\nRemember, the einstein summation convention applies, meaning that every time an index appears once as a superscript and once as a subscript, you should sum over that index.\n\nAfter calculating the christoffel symbols, you can use them for various purposes like finding geodesics, covariant derivatives, and understanding the curvature of the manifold through the riemann curvature tensor.

        "reference": "In mathematics and physics, the Christoffel symbols are an array of numbers describing a metric connection.  The metric connection is a specialization of the affine connection to surfaces or other manifolds endowed with a metric, allowing distances to be measured on that surface.  In differential geometry, an affine connection can be defined without reference to a metric, and many additional concepts follow: parallel transport, covariant derivatives, geodesics, etc. also do not require the concept of a metric. However, when a metric is available, these concepts can be directly tied to the \"shape\" of the manifold itself; that shape is determined by how the tangent space is attached to the cotangent space by the metric tensor. Abstractly, one would say that the manifold has an associated (orthonormal) frame bundle, with each \"frame\" being a possible choice of a coordinate frame. An invariant metric implies that the structure group of the frame bundle is the orthogonal group . As a result, such a manifold is necessarily a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold. The Christoffel symbols provide a concrete representation of the connection of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry in terms of coordinates on the manifold. Additional concepts, such as parallel transport, geodesics, etc. can then be expressed in terms of Christoffel symbols.\n\nIn general, there are an infinite number of metric connections for a given metric tensor; however, there is a unique connection that is free of torsion, the Levi-Civita connection. It is common in physics and general relativity to work almost exclusively with the Levi-Civita connection, by working in coordinate frames (called holonomic coordinates) where the torsion vanishes. For example, in Euclidean spaces, the Christoffel symbols describe how the local coordinate bases change from point to point.\n\nAt each point of the underlying -dimensional manifold, for any local coordinate system around that point, the Christoffel symbols are denoted  for . Each entry of this  array is a real number. Under linear coordinate transformations on the manifold, the Christoffel symbols transform like the components of a tensor, but under general coordinate transformations (diffeomorphisms) they do not.  Most of the algebraic properties of the Christoffel symbols follow from their relationship to the affine connection; only a few follow from the fact that the structure group is the orthogonal group  (or the Lorentz group  for general relativity).\n\nChristoffel symbols are used for performing practical calculations. For example, the Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed entirely in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their first partial derivatives. In general relativity, the connection plays the role of the gravitational force field with the corresponding gravitational potential being the metric tensor. When the coordinate system and the metric tensor share some symmetry, many of the  are zero.\n\nThe Christoffel symbols are named for Elwin Bruno Christoffel (1829–1900).\n\nNote\n\nThe definitions given below are valid for both Riemannian manifolds and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, such as those of general relativity, with careful distinction being made between upper and lower indices (contra-variant and co-variant indices). The formulas hold for either sign convention, unless otherwise noted.\n\nEinstein summation convention is used in this article, with vectors indicated by bold font. The connection coefficients of the Levi-Civita connection (or pseudo-Riemannian connection) expressed in a coordinate basis are called Christoffel symbols.\n\nPreliminary definitions\nGiven a coordinate system  for  on an -manifold , the tangent vectors\n\ndefine what is referred to as the local basis, with respect to the coordinate system , of the tangent space to  at each point of its domain. These can be used to define the metric tensor:\n\nand its inverse:\n\nwhich can in turn be used to define the dual basis:\n\nSome texts write  for , so that the metric tensor takes the particularly beguiling form . This convention also leaves use of the symbol  unambiguously for the vierbein.\n\nDefinition in Euclidean space\nIn Euclidean space, the general definition given below for the Christoffel symbols of the second kind can be proven to be equivalent to:\n\nChristoffel symbols of the first kind can then be found via index lowering:\n\nRearranging, we see that (assuming the partial derivative belongs to the tangent space, which can not occur on a non-Euclidean curved space):\n\nIn words, the arrays represented by the Christoffel symbols track how the basis changes from point to point. If the derivative doesn't lie on the tangent space, the right expression is the projection of the derivative over the tangent space (see covariant derivative below). Symbols of the second kind decompose the change with respect to the basis, while symbols of the first kind decompose it with respect to the dual basis. In this form, it's easy to see the symmetry of the lower or last two indices:\n and \nfrom the definition of  and the fact that partial derivatives commute (as long as the manifold and coordinate system are well behaved).",

The russell city energy center (rcec) is a 619-megawatt natural gas-fired power station situated in hayward, california. It began operating in august 2013 and is operated by calpine. The plant is built on the former landfill site of russell city, the community for which it is named.\n\nCalpine energy corporation first developed plans for the power plant in 2001, and the construction began in 2010. The plant is located near the don edwards san francisco bay national wildlife refuge, the hayward regional shoreline, the city of hayward waste water pollution control facility, and property owned by east bay discharge authority.\n\nRcec became the nation's first power plant with a federal air permit that includes a voluntary limit on greenhouse gas emissions. However, in may 2021, an explosion at the plant shut down energy production, and the city of hayward now opposes its reopening until the cause is investigated further.\n\nDesigned with two siemens westinghouse 501 fd phase 2 combustion turbine generators (ctg) and a single steam turbine generator (stg), rcec's peak output is 619 megawatts gross. The plant sells its full output of electricity to the pacific gas and electric company under a 10-year contract. Calpine corporation owns 75% of the plant's peak dispatchable capacity, or 464 megawatts, while ge energy financial services owns the remaining portion. \n\n<user> It's quite impressive that rcec is the first power plant to receive a federal air permit with a voluntary greenhouse gas emissions limit. this aspect and how their design and specifications help achieve that? also, what happened during the explosion in may 2021, and what are the current concerns of the city of hayward regarding reopening the plant? \n\n<assistant> Yes, rcec's commitment to limiting greenhouse gas emissions sets it apart from other power plants. The plant uses heat recovery steam generators (hrsgs) that capture exhaust gases from the combustion turbine generators (ctgs) to produce steam. This steam powers the single steam turbine generator (stg). This design allows for better energy efficiency, as the waste heat from the ctgs is utilized to generate additional electricity.\n\nRegarding the explosion in may 2021, unfortunately, specific details about the incident are not available in the provided information. The city of hayward is opposing the reopening of rcec until more is known about the cause of the explosion. This approach is driven by safety concerns for the surrounding community and environment. As rcec is located near a national wildlife refuge and regional shoreline, safety and environmental impact assessments become vital before considering reopening the plant. \n\n<user> Are there any other power plants in california operated by calpine? \n\n<assistant> Yes, calpine also operates the los esteros critical energy facility, located in san jose, california. This is another natural gas-fired power station like the russell city energy center. Calpine is one of the largest independent power producers in the united states, owning and operating various power plants across the country, with a focus on providing low-emission, environmentally responsible energy solutions.\n\nBeing a major power producer, calpine continues to invest in developing efficient and clean technologies, ensuring better environmental performance and contributing to a sustainable energy portfolio. By operating multiple power plants, the company strengthens the overall energy supply and grid stability in california, which is crucial for accommodating the growing demand for electricity in the state. \n\n<user> Earlier, you've mentioned that rcec sells its full output to pacific gas and electric company under a 10-year contract. specific details about peak output and baseload operation were also mentioned. can you elaborate on those concepts and how rcec demonstrates those outputs, especially in the context of the contract with pacific gas and electric company? \n\n<assistant> Sure! The peak output of rcec refers to the maximum amount of electricity the plant can generate at any given time, which is 619 megawatts gross. This capacity can be vital during times of high electricity demand, such as during heatwaves or other extreme situations.\n\nBaseload operation, on the other hand, refers to the continuous output of electricity at a steady level. In rcec's case, each gas-turbine generates 258 megawatts gross, while the steam-turbine produces 103 megawatts gross, adding up to a total of 619 megawatts gross. However, the auxiliary equipment consumes 20 megawatts, yielding a net output of 599 megawatts during baseload operation.\n\nUnder the 10-year contract with pacific gas and electric company, rcec provides its full output of electricity to the power grid. This agreement ensures that rcec's energy generation is effectively used and distributed to customers, while also providing a reliable revenue stream for the facility to sustain its operations.\n\nIn summary, the peak output and baseload operation concepts help us understand the plant's capacity to generate and sustain electricity production over time, essential details when entering a long-term contract with power distribution companies like pacific gas and electric company.

The city's strategic location on the fertile plain of argolis made it a significant stronghold during the mycenaean era. Its neighboring acropolises, mycenae and tiryns, also contributed to argos becoming an early settlement, thanks to the commanding positions they held in the midst of the argolic plain.\n\nDuring the 7th century bc, argos experienced a significant expansion and grew in power under the rule of king pheidon. Pheidon focused on regaining control over the cities of the argolid and challenging sparta's dominance in the peloponnese. Argos was a main rival of sparta, and their rivalry led to various wars and conflicts.\n\nThe battle of sepeia in 494 bc was a monumental event in argos' history. In this battle, argos suffered a devastating defeat by regional rival sparta. Following this loss, argos experienced a form of stasis, resulting in a democratic transition in the city. However, the defeat and the subsequent upheaval left argos weaker.\n\nDuring the greco-persian wars, argos remained neutral, which led to diplomatic isolation. Despite this, its prestige grew because of this neutrality, allowing argos to organize an alliance against sparta and athens in 421 bc. Unfortunately, the alliance disintegrated after the defeat at the battle of mantinea in 418 bc, further weakening argos.\n\nIn the corinthian wars, argos played a minor role against sparta. For a brief period, the city considered uniting with corinth to create an expanded argolid state, but the plan quickly fell apart. Despite remaining a minor power in greek affairs, argos escaped occupation during the reigns of philip ii and alexander the great, and it was unscathed during the wars of the diadochi. However, pyrrhus of epirus attacked argos in the battle of argos in 272 bc, during which pyrrhus was killed.\n\nOverall, argos experienced significant growth and expansion in the mycenaean era and the classical period, being involved in several wars, conflicts, and alliances. While experiencing some triumphs, it ultimately faced setbacks that weakened its power and influence in the region. \n\n<user> Fascinating! can you dive deeper into the democratic system in classical argos? how did this function during the time, and what events led to democracy being established? \n\n<assistant> Democracy in classical argos was mostly present for the period, except for a brief hiatus between 418 and 416 bc. After the crushing defeat at the battle of sepeia in 494 bc, the city experienced political instability, which resulted in the transition to democracy. The introduction of democratic rule offered a more stable and inclusive form of governance for the people of argos.\n\nThe democratic system was characterized by citizen participation in decision-making, with the general population having a say in the affairs of the city. Although we do not have specific details about the structure of the democratic system in argos, it can be assumed that it resembled other greek city-states' democratic systems. For example, in athens, the main democratic institution was the assembly (ekklesia), where free male citizens assembled to discuss and make decisions regarding city matters.\n\nDespite the establishment of democracy, argos continued to face political challenges and upheavals. However, the democratic system maintained its presence and functioned to involve citizens in the city's governance, fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility. \n\n<user> When discussing the ancient greek city of argos, i've come across the term \"argive.\" can you clarify the meaning of this term and its significance in the context of ancient greek history, particularly the trojan war? \n\n<assistant> The term \"argive\" refers to a resident of the city of argos. However, the term has a broader application in ancient greek history, particularly in the context of the trojan war. In the works of homeric bards, \"argive\" is used to denote the ancient greeks who participated in the assault on the city of troy during the trojan war.\n\nThe connection between argos and the trojan war mainly comes from the prominent role played by the city and its warriors in the conflict. Key figures in the war, such as agamemnon and diomedes, had strong ties to argos and the surrounding region, as they were leaders of the achaean forces.\n\nThus, the term \"argive\" expanded beyond its strict geographical association with argos to encompass a wider range of ancient greek warriors who were involved in the trojan war. This broadened usage signifies the importance of argos and the argolid in the cultural memory of the epic conflict. \n\n<user> How has argos managed to remain a continuously inhabited city for such an extended time? what factors have contributed to its sustained existence throughout history? \n\n<assistant> Argos' continuous habitation for over 7,000 years can be attributed to several factors that have contributed to its sustained existence throughout history. Here are some of the main factors that played a crucial role in the city's endurance:\n\n1. Strategic location: argos is situated in the fertile plain of argolis, which provides rich agricultural land and consistent water sources. This favorable environment has enabled the city to support a stable population over time.\n\n2. Geographical advantages: argos benefits from a propitious location among other notable cities, such as nemea, corinth, and arcadia. Furthermore, its proximity to lake lerna offered an additional resource at the time. These geographical features enhanced its desirability as a settlement.\n\n3. Military significance: argos has always been a stronghold in the region. Its defensible location and military prowess made it an important center for power during various periods, such as the mycenaean era and beyond. This status helped ensure the city's continued prominence and habitation.\n\n4. Economic stability: throughout history, argos has maintained a stable economy, owed mainly to agriculture, which was, and still is, the backbone of the local economy. With a fertile plain supporting agricultural activities, the economy provided the necessary resources for the population's sustenance and growth.\n\n5. Political influence: despite facing setbacks, argos managed to maintain political relevance throughout much of its history. Its involvement in various alliances, wars, and political events helped ensure its continuous habitation.\n\n6. Cultural significance: argos is deeply rooted in greek mythology and history, which can be seen in the numerous ancient monuments present within the city. Its association with legendary figures like argus and, more broadly, with the trojan war has ensured the city's cultural importance.\n\n7. Adaptation and change: argos has demonstrated an ability to adapt and change amid shifting circumstances throughout its history. For example, following its decline in political power, the city shifted its focus from the ancient agora to other parts of the city for commercial activities.\n\n8. Preservation of historical sites: the presence of many ancient monuments in argos shows a commitment to preserving its historical legacy, which has likely helped to maintain interest in the city through the ages.\n\nBy combining strategic location, geographical advantages, military significance, economic stability, political influence, cultural importance, adaptability, and historical preservation, argos has managed to maintain a continuous and thriving existence over thousands of years. These factors made the city highly attractive for settlement and persistence, ensuring the ongoing habitation of the area throughout numerous changes in history. This unique combination truly highlights the resilience and enduring nature of argos, which continues to thrive even today. ",

        "reference": "Argos (; Greek: Άργος ; Ancient Greek: Ἄργος ) is a city in Argolis, the Peloponnese, Greece and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, and the oldest in Europe. It is the largest city in Argolis and a major center for the area.\n \nSince the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the municipality of Argos-Mykines, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 138.138 km2. It is  from Nafplion, which was its historic harbour. A settlement of great antiquity, Argos has been continuously inhabited as at least a substantial village for the past 7,000 years.\n\nA resident of the city of Argos is known as an Argive ( ,  ; ). However, this term is also used to refer to those ancient Greeks generally who assaulted the city of Troy during the Trojan War; the term is more widely applied by the Homeric bards.\n\nNumerous ancient monuments can be found in the city today. Agriculture is the mainstay of the local economy.\n\nGeography\n\nClimate\nArgos has a hot Mediterranean climate. It is one of the hottest places in Greece during summer.\n\nEtymology \nThere are several proposed etyma. The name is associated with the legendary Argus, the third king of the city in ancient times, who renamed it after himself, thus replacing its older name Phoronikon Asty (Φορωνικόν Άστυ, \"Citadel of Phoroneus\"). Both the personal name and placename are linked to the word αργός (argós), which meant \"white\" or \"shining\";possibly, this had to do with the visual impression given of the Argolic plain during harvest time. According to Strabo, the name could have even originated from the word αγρός \"field\" by antimetathesis of the consonants.\n\nHistory\n\nAntiquity\n\nHerodotus first recorded the myth of the traditional story of Argos being the origin of the ancient Macedonian royal house of the Argead dynasty (Greek: Ἀργεάδαι, Argeádai) of Philip II and Alexander the Great. As a strategic location on the fertile plain of Argolis, Argos was a major stronghold during the Mycenaean era. In classical times, Argos was a powerful rival of Sparta for dominance over the Peloponnese, but was eventually shunned by other Greek city-states after remaining neutral during the Greco-Persian Wars. \n\nThere is evidence of continuous settlement in the area starting with a village about 7000 years ago in the late Neolithic, located on the foot of Aspida hill. Since that time, Argos has been continually inhabited at the same geographical location. And while the name Argos is generally accepted to have a Hellenic Indo-European etymology, Larissa is generally held to derive from a Pre-Greek substrate.\n\nThe city is located at a rather propitious area, among Nemea, Corinth and Arcadia. It also benefitted from its proximity to lake Lerna, which, at the time, was at a distance of one kilometre from the south end of Argos.\n\nArgos was a major stronghold of Mycenaean times, and along with the neighbouring acropolis of Mycenae and Tiryns became a very early settlement because of its commanding positions in the midst of the fertile plain of Argolis.\n\nArchaic Argos\n\nArgos experienced its greatest period of expansion and power under the energetic 7th century BC ruler King Pheidon. Under Pheidon, Argos regained sway over the cities of the Argolid and challenged Sparta’s dominance of the Peloponnese. Spartan dominance is thought to have been interrupted following the Battle of Hyssiae in 669–668 BC, in which Argive troops defeated the Spartans in a hoplite battle. During the time of its greatest power, the city boasted a pottery and bronze sculpturing school, pottery workshops, tanneries and clothes producers. Moreover, at least 25 celebrations took place in the city, in addition to a regular local products exhibition. A sanctuary dedicated to Hera was also found at the same spot where the monastery of Panagia Katekrymeni is located today. Pheidon also extended Argive influence throughout Greece, taking control of the Olympic Games away from the citizens of Elis and appointing himself organizer during his reign. Pheidon is also thought to have introduced reforms for standard weight and measures in Argos, a theory further reinforced with the unearthing of six \"spits\" of iron in an Argive Heraion, possibly remainders of a dedication from Pheidon.\n\nClassical Argos\n\nIn 494 BC, Argos suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of its regional rival, Sparta, at the Battle of Sepeia. Following this defeat, Herodotus tells us the city suffered a form of stasis. The political chaos is thought to have resulted in a democratic transition in the city. Argos did not participate in the Hellenic Alliance against the Persian Invasion of 480 BC. This resulted in a period of diplomatic isolation, although there is evidence of an Argive alliance with Tegea prior to 462 BC.\n\nIn 462 BC, Argos joined a tripartite alliance with Athens and Thessaly. This alliance was somewhat dysfunctional, however, and the Argives are only thought to have provided marginal contributions to the alliance at the Battle of Oenoe and Tanagra. For example, only 1,000 Argive hoplites are thought to have fought alongside the Athenians at the Battle of Tanagra. Following the allies' defeat at Tanagra in 457 BC, the alliance began to fall apart, resulting in its dissolution in 451 BC.\n\nArgos remained neutral or the ineffective ally of Athens during the Archidamian War between Sparta and Athens. Argos' neutrality resulted in a rise of its prestige among other Greek cities, and Argos used this political capital to organize and lead an alliance against Sparta and Athens in 421 BC. This alliance included Mantinea, Corinth, Elis, Thebes, Argos, and eventually Athens. This alliance fell apart, however, after the allied loss at the Battle of Mantinea in 418 BC. This defeat, combined with the raiding of the Argolid by the Epidaurians, resulted in political instability and an eventual oligarchic coup in 417 BC. Although democracy was restored within a year, Argos was left permanently weakened by this coup. This weakening led to a loss of power, which in turn led to the shift of commercial focus from the Ancient Agora to the eastern side of the city, delimited by Danaou and Agiou Konstadinou streets.\n\nArgos played a minor role in the Corinthian Wars against Sparta, and for a short period of time considered uniting with Corinth to form an expanded Argolid state. For a brief period of time, the two poleis combined, but Corinth quickly rebelled against Argive domination, and Argos returned to its traditional boundaries. After this, Argos continued to remain a minor power in Greek affairs.\n\nArgos escaped occupation by Macedon during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great and remained unscathed during the Wars of the Diadochi, however in 272 it was attacked by Pyrrhus of Epirus at the Battle of Argos, in which Pyrrhus was killed.\n\nDemocracy in Classical Argos\n\nArgos was a democracy for most of the classical period, with only a brief hiatus between 418 and 416.",

They are commonly found in permanently cold regions like the polar areas, deep sea, permafrost, polar ice, and glaciers. Examples of psychrophiles include bacteria, archaea, lichens, snow algae, phytoplankton, fungi, and wingless midges.\n\nTo survive in these harsh conditions, psychrophiles have developed specific adaptations:\n\n1. Ice-induced desiccation and vitrification: they are protected from freezing and ice expansion through a process called vitrification (glass transition) as long as they cool slowly. They can maintain limited metabolic activity in extracellular fluid at sub-zero temperatures and remain viable once returned to normal temperatures.\n\n2. Lipid cell membrane modification: psychrophiles adapt their lipid cell membrane structures to contain a higher content of short, unsaturated fatty acids. This allows for a lower melting point and increased membrane fluidity, crucial for survival and functionality.\n\n3. Carotenoids: these compounds help modulate membrane fluidity.\n\n4. Antifreeze proteins: psychrophiles synthesize these proteins to keep their internal space liquid and protect their dna when temperatures drop below water's freezing point. These proteins prevent ice formation or recrystallization.\n\n5. Enzyme adaptation: psychrophile enzymes display an activity-stability-flexibility relationship to adapt to the cold. Their enzyme structures are more flexible to compensate for the freezing environmental effects.\n\nIn addition to cold adaptation, some psychrophiles like certain gram-negative bacteria can enter a viable but nonculturable (vbnc) state. This state allows them to respire and metabolize substrates but not replicate, and it can be highly reversible, helping them survive long periods of time under harsh conditions. \n\n<user> Your explanation is interesting! how do these organisms impact their ecosystems, and by living in extreme cold conditions, do they play a role in climate change? \n\n<assistant> Psychrophiles play important roles in their ecosystems. They are responsible for nutrient cycling and energy flow in cold environments. They break down organic matter, contributing to decomposition processes and releasing nutrients back into the environment. This supports life and, in some cases, even creates habitable conditions for other living organisms.\n\nIn terms of climate change, psychrophiles can have both direct and indirect effects. Due to their capacity to metabolize organic matter — including the decomposition of permafrost — they release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. This process can contribute to the overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions and may accelerate global warming. However, it is important to note that psychrophiles' overall impact on climate change is still an active area of research, and their role might be more complex than we currently understand.\n\nAdditionally, the study of psychrophiles and their adaptation mechanisms can provide valuable insights into extremophile biology, biotechnology, astrobiology, and our understanding of life on earth and potential life beyond our planet. \n\n<user> As an expert in the field, i have a doubt about the influence of multidrug resistance in psychrophiles. can you give me more details about that? \n\n<assistant> The topic of multidrug resistance in psychrophiles is indeed intriguing. The extremophilic nature of these microorganisms has been known to promote adaptations that may enable them to resist multiple antibiotics or other antimicrobial agents.\n\nA key factor that has been observed to cause multidrug resistance in extremophiles, including psychrophiles, is the presence of efflux pumps in their cell membranes. These pumps are responsible for actively transporting antibiotics or toxic substances out of the cell, consequently reducing their intracellular concentration and decreasing their effectiveness.\n\nHorizontal gene transfer, via mechanisms such as plasmids, conjugation, or even phage-mediated transduction, may also contribute to the spread of multidrug resistance among psychrophiles. These genetic exchanges can transfer antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria, facilitating the emergence of drug-resistant strains.\n\nIt's important to mention that the study of extreme environmental conditions and their relationship with multidrug resistance may help us better comprehend the evolution of resistance mechanisms in these microorganisms. Understanding these mechanisms can contribute to the development of new antimicrobial strategies or the mitigation of multidrug-resistant infections. \n\n<user> I want to dig a bit deeper into the taxonomic range of psychrophiles. can you provide more examples of their diverse classifications? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! The taxonomic range of psychrophiles is indeed diverse, reflecting their remarkable ability to inhabit cold environments. Some examples of psychrophiles across different classifications include:\n\n1. Bacteria:\n- Arthrobacter sp.\n- Psychrobacter sp.\n- Halomonas spp.\n- Pseudomonas spp.\n- Hyphomonas spp.\n- Sphingomonas spp.\n- Chryseobacterium greenlandensis, found in 120,000-year-old ice\n\n2. Lichens:\n- Umbilicaria antarctica\n- Xanthoria elegans, which can photosynthesize at temperatures as low as -24 °C\n\n3. Microalgae (snow and ice algae):\n- Chloromonas spp.\n- Chlamydomonas spp.\n\n4. Fungi:\n- Many cold-adapted fungal species that can survive and metabolize in low temperatures\n\n5. Insects:\n- Certain Chironomidae family members, which can be active at temperatures as low as -16 °C\n\nThese examples demonstrate the incredible diversity and adaptability of psychrophiles within various taxonomic groups. They offer a glimpse into the potential for the discovery of more extremophilic organisms that have evolved to thrive in cold environments across the planet. ",

        "reference": "Psychrophiles or cryophiles (adj. psychrophilic or cryophilic) are extremophilic organisms that are capable of growth and reproduction in low temperatures, ranging from −20 °C to +10 °C. They are found in places that are permanently cold, such as the polar regions and the deep sea. They can be contrasted with thermophiles, which are organisms that thrive at unusually high temperatures, and mesophiles at intermediate temperatures. Psychrophile is Greek for 'cold-loving', from ψυχρός (psukhrós: cold, frozen).\n\nMany such organisms are bacteria or archaea, but some eukaryotes such as lichens, snow algae, phytoplankton, fungi, and wingless midges, are also classified as psychrophiles.\n\nBiology\n\nHabitat\nThe cold environments that psychrophiles inhabit are ubiquitous on Earth, as a large fraction of our planetary surface experiences temperatures lower than 10 °C. They are present in permafrost, polar ice, glaciers, snowfields and deep ocean waters. These organisms can also be found in pockets of sea ice with high salinity content. Microbial activity has been measured in soils frozen below −39 °C. In addition to their temperature limit, psychrophiles must also adapt to other extreme environmental constraints that may arise as a result of their habitat. These constraints include high pressure in the deep sea, and high salt concentration on some sea ice.\n\nAdaptations\nPsychrophiles are protected from freezing and the expansion of ice by ice-induced desiccation and vitrification (glass transition), as long as they cool slowly. Free living cells desiccate and vitrify between −10 °C and −26 °C. Cells of multicellular organisms may vitrify at temperatures below −50 °C. The cells may continue to have some metabolic activity in the extracellular fluid down to these temperatures, and they remain viable once restored to normal temperatures.\n\nThey must also overcome the stiffening of their lipid cell membrane, as this is important for the survival and functionality of these organisms. To accomplish this, psychrophiles adapt lipid membrane structures that have a high content of short, unsaturated fatty acids. Compared to longer saturated fatty acids, incorporating this type of fatty acid allows for the lipid cell membrane to have a lower melting point, which increases the fluidity of the membranes. In addition, carotenoids are present in the membrane, which help modulate the fluidity of it.\n\nAntifreeze proteins are also synthesized to keep psychrophiles' internal space liquid, and to protect their DNA when temperatures drop below water's freezing point. By doing so, the protein prevents any ice formation or recrystallization process from occurring.\n\nThe enzymes of these organisms have been hypothesized to engage in an activity-stability-flexibility relationship as a method for adapting to the cold; the flexibility of their enzyme structure will increase as a way to compensate for the freezing effect of their environment.\n\nCertain cryophiles, such as Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio and Aeromonas spp., can transition into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. During VBNC, a micro-organism can respire and use substrates for metabolism – however, it cannot replicate. An advantage of this state is that it is highly reversible. It has been debated whether VBNC is an active survival strategy or if eventually the organism's cells will no longer be able to be revived. There is proof however it may be very effective –  Gram positive bacteria Actinobacteria have been shown to have lived about 500,000 years in the permafrost conditions of Antarctica, Canada, and Siberia.\n\nTaxonomic range\nPsychrophiles include bacteria, lichens, snow algae, phytoplankton, fungi, and insects.\n\nAmong the bacteria that can tolerate extreme cold are Arthrobacter sp., Psychrobacter sp. and members of the genera Halomonas, Pseudomonas, Hyphomonas, and Sphingomonas. Another example is Chryseobacterium greenlandensis, a psychrophile that was found in 120,000-year-old ice.\n\nUmbilicaria antarctica and Xanthoria elegans are lichens that have been recorded photosynthesizing at temperatures ranging down to −24 °C, and they can grow down to around −10 °C. Some multicellular eukaryotes can also be metabolically active at sub-zero temperatures, such as some conifers; those in the Chironomidae family are still active at −16 °C.\n\nMicroalgae that live in snow and ice include green, brown, and red algae.

        "reference": "University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) is the health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) and is located in Jackson, Mississippi, United States. UMMC, also referred to as the Medical Center, is the state's only  academic medical center.\n\nUMMC houses seven health science schools: Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Health Related Professions, Graduate Studies in the Health Sciences, Population Health and Pharmacy. (The main School of Pharmacy is headquartered on the University of Mississippi (UM) campus in Oxford, Mississippi.) The 164-acre campus also includes University Hospital, Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants, Conerly Critical Care Hospital, Children's of Mississippi (including the Blair E. Batson Tower and the Kathy and Joe Sanderson Tower), the state's only children's hospital, and Rowland Medical Library.\n\nHistory\nThe University of Mississippi Medical Center opened in 1955, but its beginnings date to 1903 when a two-year medical school was established on the parent campus in Oxford. In that era, certificate graduates went out of state to complete their doctor of medicine degrees.\n\nFinally, in 1950, the Mississippi Legislature enacted a law to create a four-year medical school associated with the University of Mississippi. On July 1, 1955, the state's new Medical Center, then commonly referred to as UMC, opened in Jackson, initially as a four-year medical school with medical and graduate students, interns and residents. As it had in Oxford, the School of Medicine offered both medical and graduate degree programs. The campus included a teaching hospital and a library.\n\nThe Oxford campus' nursing department moved to the Medical Center in 1956 and was granted school status in 1958. The School of Health Related Professions (SHRP) was added in 1971 and began offering baccalaureate curricula in 1973. The School of Dentistry was authorized in 1973, and its first students were admitted in 1975. The graduate program was elevated to school status in 2001 and designated the School of Graduate Studies in the Health Sciences.\n\nThe parcel of land on which UMMC's University Hospital sits was once the site of the Mississippi Insane Asylum, which moved its operations in 1935 to Whitfield, Miss., and became Mississippi State Hospital. The bodies of perhaps seven thousand patients have been found on campus in unmarked graves.\n\nCivil rights era\nAt its opening in 1955, UMMC provided care to African-American patients, but the patient-care facilities were segregated by race, according to local laws in the South at the time. In 1963, civil rights leader Medgar Evers was rushed to UMMC after being shot at his home in Jackson, MS, but he died in the hospital emergency room. In 1964, UMMC became the primary medical provider for injured Freedom Riders.\n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited federally funded institutions from discriminating. In 1965, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a federal civil rights complaint against UMMC. Robert Q. Marston, MD, then medical dean and Medical Center director, developed a compliance strategy which included hiring the first black faculty member, and integrating the hospitals and clinics.\n\nAt about the same time, Dr. Blair E. Batson, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at UMMC, offered a position in the department's residency education program to Dr. Aaron Shirley, an African-American physician who had attended medical school in Tennessee. Shirley became the first African-American learner at UMMC when he entered the residency program in 1965.\n\nAbout \nAs the academic health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi, the Medical Center functions as a separately accredited, semi-autonomous unit responsible to the chancellor of the university and through him to the constitutional Board of Trustees of the State Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL). The University of Mississippi Medical Center is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award baccalaureate, master's and doctorate degrees.\n\nThe Medical Center also is accredited by The Joint Commission.\n\nThe IHL Board of Trustees appoints the UM chancellor, who then recommends a candidate for UMMC's vice chancellor for health affairs. The vice chancellor also serves as the dean of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. LouAnn Woodward, MD, was named March 1, 2015, to fill the vice chancellor position. She is responsible for the overall strategic direction of the Medical Center. She is the first woman and the 10th person to hold the post.\n\nEnrollment in UMMC's 35 degree programs is more than 3,000 students. Admission preference is given to Mississippi residents in an effort to supply professionals to meet the state's health-care needs.\n\nThe Associated Student Body (ASB) is the student government association for UMMC. It serves as a mechanism to organize student extracurricular activities and to voice student concerns, ideas, and questions to the administration and community.\n\nUMMC is the only hospital in the state designated as a Level 1 trauma center. Specialized hospital services include: an interventional MRI; the only Level 4 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the state; separate medical, surgical, cardiac, neuroscience and pediatric ICUs; a heart station for diagnosis and treatment of heart disease; a heart failure clinic; heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, cornea and bone marrow transplant programs; a comprehensive stroke unit; state-of-the-art radiological imaging systems; a sleep disorders laboratory; an in vitro fertilization program; and special pharmaceutical services.\n\nA portion of land on the UMMC campus was once the site of the Mississippi Insane Asylum, which moved its operations in 1935 and became Mississippi State Hospital.\n\nMedical facilities\nUMMC has the only hospital in the state designated as a Level 1 trauma center, and the state's only Level 4 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) located in the Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants. The Medical Center also has the only organ transplant (adult and pediatric) program and OB/GYN emergency room in Mississippi.\n\nWith a total of 1,003 beds, including Holmes County and Grenada locations, UMMC is the largest diagnostic, treatment and referral care system in the state. Based on the latest fiscal year (2013–14) statistics, inpatient admissions at the multiple locations totaled more than 33,000, with more than 487,000 hospital outpatient visits. The UMMC emergency rooms in Jackson had 70,000 visits, while Grenada had 18,324 and Holmes County had 6,657.\n\nHospitals include:\n University Hospital\n Wallace Conerly Critical Care Hospital\n Winfred L.

At harrow, he was head of school and captain of the school's rugby and harrow football teams. During his time there, in 1977, he initiated the school tradition of long ducker, a 20-mile run raising funds for charity. Hadow attended university college london, where he was awarded the professor bill mead scholarship, and graduated with a ba (hons) in geography in 1984.\n\nHadow's early career began at mark mccormack's sports organisation from 1985 to 1988. He worked as an agent representing the european equestrian interests of international management group (img). One of his accomplishments during this time was managing img’s relationship with the swedish equestrian federation to secure funds through corporate sponsorship to cover the staging costs of the inaugural world equestrian games in stockholm (1990). The games combined the world championship events of six disciplines under the international equestrian federation (fei).\n\nIn 1995, hadow shifted gears and founded the polar travel company, providing guided expeditions to the arctic and antarctic.

They occur in three distinct regions in Pacific basin tributaries and endorheic basins in the western United States.  The three subspecies are the Columbia River redband trout (O. m. gairdneri), the McCloud River redband trout (O. m. stonei) and the Great Basin redband trout (O. m. newberrii).\n\nThe Columbia River redband trout is found in the Columbia River and its tributaries in Montana, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Anadromous populations of  O. m. gairdneri are known as redband steelhead.  The McCloud River redband trout is found in small tributaries of the McCloud River and Pit River which are tributaries of California's Sacramento River.  The Great Basin redband trout is found in seven distinct basins in southeastern Oregon, and parts of California and Nevada on the periphery of the Great Basin.  Redband trout have often been confused with cutthroat trout (Oncorynchus clarki).  Redband trout are prized game fish.\n\nThroughout their distribution, the redband trout have been facing declines due to altered or destroyed habitats, introduction of exotic and hatchery-raised fish species and seasonal drought.  However, as of 2000, the population of Great Basin redband trout was not a candidate for listing as threatened or endangered by the standards established by the United States Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nPhysical characteristics\nThe redband trout are generally similar in appearance to the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus) but have larger, more rounded spots, parr marks that tend to remain into adulthood, are more orange-red around the lateral line and have very distinct white tips on the anal, dorsal and pectoral fins. They will exceed  at maturity, which they reach within three years. The redband trout subspecies find their ideal habitat in clean, cool, relatively small and low gradient streams, but are capable of enduring higher water temperatures (75–80 °F; 24–27 °C) than other trout that may co-habit the same streams.

It is the world's smallest independent state, covering an area of just 49 hectares (121 acres or 0.19 square miles). This tiny size is one of its defining features. Additionally, thirteen buildings in rome and castel gandolfo, such as the pope's summer residence, have extraterritorial rights, which also adds to its distinctive geography. The paul vi audience hall is another unique structure, as it straddles the border between vatican city and italy, and its italian portion has extraterritorial rights as well. \n\n<user> Climate and terrain of vatican city. \n\n<assistant> Vatican city's climate mirrors that of rome, which is temperate and mild. The city experiences rainy winters from september to mid-may, and hot, dry summers from may to september. As for the terrain, vatican city is situated on a low hill called the vatican hill or mons vaticanus. This hill has its historical significance as its name predates christianity. While it is believed that an etruscan settlement named vatica or vaticum might have existed in an area known to the ancient romans as \"vatican territory\" (vaticanus ager), no archaeological evidence of it has been discovered so far. \n\n<user> Can you give me information about the extreme points, land use, environment, and the international agreements of vatican city? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Vatican city has extreme points which are the farthest north, south, east, or west within the city-state, as well as its highest and lowest points. These are:\n\n- north: intersection of viale vaticano and via leone iv\n- south: intersection of via della stazione vaticana and via di porta cavalleggeri\n- west: intersection of viale vaticano and via aurelia\n- east: easternmost edge of saint peter's square\n\nThe lowest point is an unnamed location, while the highest point is also unnamed.

It is an excellent example of land economy due to its limited territory, with urban development occupying around half of the total area and the rest reserved for open spaces, including the vatican gardens.\n\nVatican city's environmental practices include accepting an offer in 2007 to become a carbon neutral state through the vatican climate forest in hungary, but no trees were planted, and the carbon offsets were not realized.\n\nAs for international agreements, vatican city is a party to the ozone layer protection agreement. It has also signed, but not ratified, agreements related to air pollution and environmental modification. \n\n<user> What about its rail line and train station? \n\n<assistant> Vatican city possesses a rail line and train station within its borders, which contributes to its autonomy as a sovereign state. The train station, known as vatican city railway station (stazione città del vaticano), is mainly used for freight transport, special trains for the pope and his entourage, and occasional tourist excursions. It is connected to italy's rail network and is mainly served by the italian state railways. The railway station, along with other facilities like a heliport, post office, radio station, military barracks, government offices, public plazas, and cultural institutions, enables the city-state to function independently and efficiently despite its small size.

(One building, the Paul VI Audience Hall, straddles the border, but its Italian portion has extraterritorial rights.) The country contains no major natural resources, and no known natural hazards other than those that affect Rome in general, such as earthquakes.\n\nClimate\n\nThe city state has the same climate as Rome: temperate, mild, rainy winters (September to mid-May) with hot, dry summers (May to September).\n\nTerrain\n\nVatican City sits on a low hill. The hill has been called the Vatican Hill (in Latin, Mons Vaticanus) since long before Christianity existed.

The city state displays an impressive degree of land economy, born of necessity due to its extremely limited territory. Thus, the urban development (i.e., buildings) is optimized to occupy about half of the total area, while the rest is reserved for open space, including the Vatican Gardens. The territory holds many diverse structures that help provide autonomy for the sovereign state, including a rail line and train station, heliport, post office, radio station (with extraterritorial antennas in Italy), military barracks, government palaces and offices, public plaza, part of an audience hall, old defensive wall marking the border, institutions of higher learning, and cultural/art centers.\n\nEnvironment\nIn July 2007, the Vatican accepted an offer that would make it the only carbon neutral state for the year, due to the donation of the Vatican Climate Forest in Hungary.

The russell city energy center (rcec) is a 619-megawatt natural gas-fired power station situated in hayward, california. It began operating in august 2013 and is operated by calpine. The plant is built on the former landfill site of russell city, the community for which it is named.\n\nCalpine energy corporation first developed plans for the power plant in 2001, and the construction began in 2010. The plant is located near the don edwards san francisco bay national wildlife refuge, the hayward regional shoreline, the city of hayward waste water pollution control facility, and property owned by east bay discharge authority.\n\nRcec became the nation's first power plant with a federal air permit that includes a voluntary limit on greenhouse gas emissions. However, in may 2021, an explosion at the plant shut down energy production, and the city of hayward now opposes its reopening until the cause is investigated further.\n\nDesigned with two siemens westinghouse 501 fd phase 2 combustion turbine generators (ctg) and a single steam turbine generator (stg), rcec's peak output is 619 megawatts gross. The plant sells its full output of electricity to the pacific gas and electric company under a 10-year contract. Calpine corporation owns 75% of the plant's peak dispatchable capacity, or 464 megawatts, while ge energy financial services owns the remaining portion. \n\n<user> It's quite impressive that rcec is the first power plant to receive a federal air permit with a voluntary greenhouse gas emissions limit. this aspect and how their design and specifications help achieve that? also, what happened during the explosion in may 2021, and what are the current concerns of the city of hayward regarding reopening the plant? \n\n<assistant> Yes, rcec's commitment to limiting greenhouse gas emissions sets it apart from other power plants. The plant uses heat recovery steam generators (hrsgs) that capture exhaust gases from the combustion turbine generators (ctgs) to produce steam. This steam powers the single steam turbine generator (stg). This design allows for better energy efficiency, as the waste heat from the ctgs is utilized to generate additional electricity.\n\nRegarding the explosion in may 2021, unfortunately, specific details about the incident are not available in the provided information. The city of hayward is opposing the reopening of rcec until more is known about the cause of the explosion. This approach is driven by safety concerns for the surrounding community and environment. As rcec is located near a national wildlife refuge and regional shoreline, safety and environmental impact assessments become vital before considering reopening the plant. \n\n<user> Are there any other power plants in california operated by calpine? \n\n<assistant> Yes, calpine also operates the los esteros critical energy facility, located in san jose, california. This is another natural gas-fired power station like the russell city energy center. Calpine is one of the largest independent power producers in the united states, owning and operating various power plants across the country, with a focus on providing low-emission, environmentally responsible energy solutions.\n\nBeing a major power producer, calpine continues to invest in developing efficient and clean technologies, ensuring better environmental performance and contributing to a sustainable energy portfolio. By operating multiple power plants, the company strengthens the overall energy supply and grid stability in california, which is crucial for accommodating the growing demand for electricity in the state. \n\n<user> Earlier, you've mentioned that rcec sells its full output to pacific gas and electric company under a 10-year contract. specific details about peak output and baseload operation were also mentioned. can you elaborate on those concepts and how rcec demonstrates those outputs, especially in the context of the contract with pacific gas and electric company? \n\n<assistant> Sure! The peak output of rcec refers to the maximum amount of electricity the plant can generate at any given time, which is 619 megawatts gross. This capacity can be vital during times of high electricity demand, such as during heatwaves or other extreme situations.\n\nBaseload operation, on the other hand, refers to the continuous output of electricity at a steady level. In rcec's case, each gas-turbine generates 258 megawatts gross, while the steam-turbine produces 103 megawatts gross, adding up to a total of 619 megawatts gross. However, the auxiliary equipment consumes 20 megawatts, yielding a net output of 599 megawatts during baseload operation.\n\nUnder the 10-year contract with pacific gas and electric company, rcec provides its full output of electricity to the power grid. This agreement ensures that rcec's energy generation is effectively used and distributed to customers, while also providing a reliable revenue stream for the facility to sustain its operations.\n\nIn summary, the peak output and baseload operation concepts help us understand the plant's capacity to generate and sustain electricity production over time, essential details when entering a long-term contract with power distribution companies like pacific gas and electric company.

He authored multiple books exploring the region's cultural and historical intricacies. His works included biographies, historical accounts, and analysis of the geopolitical situation.\n\nBenoist-méchin's experiences in journalism, politics, and diplomacy, along with his intellectual pursuits, likely facilitated his research and understanding of the arab world. Despite his controversial past, he managed to create a new chapter in his life immersed in the study of a different culture and region.\n\nIn this second part of his life, benoist-méchin was less associated with his earlier collaborationist activities and gained recognition as a knowledgeable and respected expert on the arab world.

Well known as a journalist and historian, he later became prominent for his collaborationism under the Vichy regime. After his conviction in 1947 and release from prison in 1954, he became an Arab world expert in the second part of his life.\n\nEarly years\nBenoist-Méchin was educated at leading schools in Switzerland and the United Kingdom as well as the Lycée Louis-le-Grand before attending the Sorbonne. He subsequently served in the French Army, spending the period from 1921 to 1923 as part of the forces involved in the occupation of the Rhineland. He then became a journalist, working for the International News Service from 1924 to 1927 and was appointed editor of L'Europe Nouvelle in 1930 by Louise Weiss.\n\nPolitical career\nA critic of democracy, Benoist-Méchin joined the French Popular Party in 1936. A noted Germanophile, he joined the Comité France-Allemagne, a group dedicated to fostering closer links between the two countries. Despite this his earlier military service meant that when war broke out between the two countries in 1939 he was mobilised and during the Battle of France he was captured and for a time held as a prisoner of war in Voves. He was quickly freed however and served as chief of the POWs diplomatic mission to Berlin, aimed at securing the release of those held in Germany.\n\nIn the main the Germanophile Benoist-Méchin somewhat welcomed the German occupation of France during World War II. He served as an undersecretary in François Darlan's cabinet and, along with Pierre Pucheu and Paul Marion, became part of the so-called \"young cyclists\" group of pro-German Darlan loyalists. The 11 May 1941, he accompanied Darlan to Berchtesgaden in order to negotiate military facilities in Syria for Germany with Hitler. In early 1942 he received from his personal friend Otto Abetz an offer that would guarantee France effective independence if the country agreed to become a military ally of Germany, although when the offer was officially made the terms had been watered down somewhat. Despite this loss of face Benoist-Méchin was an enthusiastic collaborator who claimed that France was working with Germany rather than opposing her and risking further defeat or working for her and thus becoming subservient. He was briefly the official ambassador for the collaborationist government in occupied Paris although early on this role passed to fellow Germanophile Fernand de Brinon.\n\nA minister without portfolio in Vichy France, Benoist-Méchin's influence grew when he, along with his allies Paul Marion and Joseph Darnand, was appointed to the controlling committee of the Légion des Volontaires Français in June 1942. In this position he suggested renaming the group Légion Tricolore and converting it into a professional military unit, an idea soon adopted. Increasingly sidelined by Pierre Laval, Benoist-Méchin was involved in plotting with Darnand and Jacques Doriot for the three men to form a pro-Nazi triumvirate to administer Vichy France but the plan came to nothing.\n\nHe was arrested in September 1944 for his role as collaborator. His trial began on 9 May 1947 before the High Court of Justice. He was accused of tactical and strategic collaboration with the enemy. On 6 June, Benoist-Méchin was sentenced to death and indignité nationale.",

The objective of the game is for players to visit as many cities as possible and then return to their \"home city.\" home cities are determined at the beginning of the game and remain hidden until the end. The game is designed for 2–6 players, but 4–5 players make for the best experience.\n\nPlayers move around the board using transportation cards, which represent various types of fantastical vehicles, such as troll wagons, elf cycles, rafts, giant pigs, unicorns, dragons, and magic clouds. Each vehicle is better suited for specific terrain, and some cannot travel over certain terrains at all.\n\nBefore moving, players draw and lay out tiles across the board to create roads for their mode of transport. This step involves strategic thinking, as players try to set up favorable routes for themselves while hindering the routes of their opponents.\n\nIn addition to normal tiles, each player receives one trouble tile, which forces other players to use an extra transportation card during the game. Players can also use any three cards to pass any route with a tile already placed, enabling them to ignore the transport type shown on that tile. The game emphasizes strategic thinking and decision-making as players navigate around the board. \n\n<user> That's an interesting concept! any awards the game has received? \n\n<assistant> Yes, elfenland has received notable recognition in the world of board games. It won the prestigious spiel des jahres award in 1998, which is a highly regarded accolade in the industry. In addition, the game secured third place in the deutscher spiele preis awards in the same year. These awards highlight the game's popularity, quality, and appeal to players. \n\n<user> Wow, that sounds like a great game. has there been any expansions or updates since its release? \n\n<assistant> Indeed, an expansion for elfenland called elfengold was published, which adds new elements and game mechanics to the original game. It's worth noting that this expansion is different from the original elfengold published by white wind, which was tied to the earlier game elfenroads. Alan r. Moon simplified and redeveloped elfenroads into elfenland to make it more suitable as a family game, reducing the playing time to around an hour. \n\nIf you enjoy the base game of elfenland, the elfengold expansion can provide you with added layers of strategy, complexity, and depth to the gameplay. However, elfenland itself remains a fun and engaging board game on its own, offering a blend of strategic planning and exciting competition, both for families and groups of friends. ",

In contrast, algiers managed to achieve continuous water supply with the help of a french private company, suez, in 2011.\n\nAlgeria's drinking water comes from sources including surface water, groundwater, and seawater desalination. Water resources and infrastructure face challenges like saline intrusion, seasonal rainfall, and pollution of water sources, which necessitates projects like reservoirs, water transfer systems, and desalination plants to provide adequate water supplies to the people. \n\n<user> Are there protests related to water shortages? \n\n<assistant> Yes, water shortages have led to protests in some areas of algeria. For example, in setif, a city in northeastern algeria, residents have experienced water shortages, which have resulted in demonstrations and clashes with the police. Such protests typically arise due to inadequate service quality, intermittent water supply, and dissatisfaction with infrastructure developments. \n\n<user> How are they trying to solve the water supply problems, especially in areas with major shortages? \n\n<assistant> Algeria is working to address water supply issues in several ways:\n\n1. Building reservoirs: these are used to store surface water since rainfall is highly seasonal. They help provide consistent water supply during dry periods.\n2. Long-distance water transfers: projects like the \"project of the century\" transfer non-renewable groundwater from one part of the country to another, such as from in salah to tamanrasset in the sahara over a distance of 750 km.\n3. Desalination plants: algeria has built 15 seawater desalination plants along its coast, with plans to build 43 more by 2019. This provides an alternative source of water, especially for coastal regions.\n4. Wastewater treatment and reuse: by constructing treatment plants and sewer networks, treated water can be reused for agriculture, helping to conserve water resources.\n5. Partnerships with private companies: algeria has collaborated with private entities, like the french company suez, to improve infrastructure and water management systems, resulting in successes like continuous water supply in algiers.\n\nThese steps help increase the overall water supply, address shortages in various regions, and improve the sustainability of water resources in algeria. \n\n<user> Are there any efforts to combat pollution in water sources? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are ongoing efforts to tackle pollution in water sources in algeria. Some of the measures being implemented include:\n\n1. Sewer network development: investments have been made to build sewers, pumping stations, and treatment plants to convey reclaimed water to agricultural areas for reuse. This helps reduce pollution from septic tank seepage in locations, like the valleys of el oued and ouargla.\n2. Monitoring water quality: authorities track the levels of pollutants, such as nitrates, manganese, and chlorides in surface water and groundwater to ensure they remain within permissible limits set by organizations like the world health organization (who).\n3. Improved wastewater treatment: the increase in wastewater treatment plants helps reduce the pollution load on rivers and other water bodies. This has contributed to better water quality at beaches and other areas used for recreational purposes.\n4. Awareness and education programs: these initiatives are designed to inform the public about the importance of water conservation and proper waste disposal to minimize pollution.\n\nWhile there is still work to be done, these efforts demonstrate algeria's commitment to addressing pollution in water sources and preserving the quality of their water resources for current and future generations.

        "reference": "Drinking water supply and sanitation in Algeria is characterized by achievements and challenges. Among the achievements is a substantial increase in the amount of drinking water supplied from reservoirs, long-distance water transfers and desalination at a low price to consumers, thanks to the country's substantial oil and gas revenues. These measures increased per capita water supply despite a rapidly increasing population. Another achievement is the transition from intermittent to continuous water supply in the capital Algiers in 2011, along with considerable improvements in wastewater treatment resulting in better water quality at beaches. These achievements were made possible through a public-private partnership with a private French water company. The number of wastewater treatment plants throughout the country increased rapidly from only 18 in 2000 to 113 in 2011, with 96 more under construction. However, there are also many challenges. One of them is poor service quality in many cities outside Algiers with 78% of urban residents suffering from intermittent water supply. Another challenge is the pollution of water resources. There has also been insufficient progress concerning reuse of treated water, a government priority in this dry country.\n\nAccess\n\nIn 2015, in Algeria 84% of the population had access to \"improved\" water, 84% and 82%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. In 2015, there were still around 7 million lacking access to \"improved\" water. Regarding sanitation, 88% of the population had access to \"improved\" sanitation, 90% and 82%, in urban and rural areas, respectively.\n\nAccording to the UN, 84% of Algerians had access to an improved water source in 2010.      , including 74% that had access to drinking water on their premises. The remainder had access to fountains, standpipes, protected wells or protected springs, mostly in rural areas. 95% of Algerians had access to improved sanitation. The Algerian government states that access water supply is higher than shown in the UN statistics, with 93% being linked to drinking water networks in 2010. It also says that 86% of the population are connected to sewer networks.\n\nService quality\nOnly 22% of urban residents in Algeria receive water 24 hours per day. 34% receive water only once per day, 24% every second day and 14% only every third day. In some regions water only comes every 10 days, such as in the Bouzeguène District and other districts in the Kabylie region. These shortages are \npoor execution and lack of completion of works, poor maintenance and numerous illegal connections to the network. Residents store water in tanks or jerry cans in their houses, or fill up jerry cans at water towers particularly during the summer. In Setif in Northeastern Algeria water shortages have led to protests and clashes with the police. In contrast, in Algiers continuous water supply was established with the help of a French private company, SUEZ, in 2011.\n\nWater resources and infrastructure\nDrinking water in Algeria comes from conventional resources – surface water and groundwater – as well as non-conventional resources such as seawater desalination.\n\nConventional water resources\n \nSince rainfall is highly seasonal, surface water is stored in 72 reservoirs with a total production capacity of 7.4 billion m3 per year in 2009. Most of this water is used for irrigation. Total drinking water supply was about 2.8 billion m3 per year. One of the largest reservoir systems in Algeria is the Beni Haroun complex in Mila Province that supplies water for irrigation and drinking water to 4 million people in six provinces in the East of Algeria. Another large system is the Taksebt complex in Tizi Ouzou in Kabylie. It supplies three provinces, including parts of the capital Algiers, with drinking water. In the Bouira Province, water is supplied from the Koudiat Acerdoune dam. The longest water transfer project in Algeria, dubbed \"project of the century\", transfers non-renewable groundwater from  In Salah to Tamanrasset in the Sahara over a distance of 750 km. It was completed in 2011 at a cost of US$2.5 billion.\n\nIn some parts of the country, such as in the valleys of El Oued and Ouargla, a rising water table due to seepage from septic tanks was a major problem. Beginning in 2005 at a cost of almost US$1 billion sewers were laid, pumping stations and treatment plants were built to convey the reclaimed water to agricultural areas for reuse.\n\nPollution of water resources has reached a worrying degree. Groundwater in the Mitidja plain close to Algiers is polluted with nitrates, and groundwater in coastal areas is often damaged by saline intrusion from the sea due to overpumping. This is the case in the Oran, Algiers and Jijel areas. Major parts of the rivers Tafna, Macta, Chéliff, Soummam and Seybousse are polluted. Some of them, such as the country's largest river, the Chéliff that supplies the Oran area, are used for drinking water supply. In the Constantine area the level of manganese and of chlorides in drinking water was close to those allowed by the WHO as of 2004.\n\nNon-conventional water resources\n\nDesalination \nAlgeria had 15 seawater desalination plants along its coast in 2011 with a capacity of 2.3 million m3/day. It plans to build 43 more until 2019.",

Dyadic rationals, which are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction with a power of two as the denominator, have several applications in real life. Let's look at a few key areas where dyadic rationals are commonly used:\n\n1. In measurement: many traditional systems of weights and measures are based on repeated halving, which produces dyadic rationals when measuring fractional amounts. For instance, the customary divisions of an inch and a gallon are based on dyadic rationals, involving subdivisions like 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8. Ancient egyptians also used dyadic rationals in measurement, with denominators reaching up to 64. Similarly, the indus valley civilization employed weight systems primarily based on repeated halving.\n\n2. In computing: dyadic rationals are crucial in computer science, as they are the only numbers with finite binary representations. Computers manipulate this type of fractional number directly. Examples of dyadic rationals include floating-point numbers, which are often defined as integers multiplied by positive or negative powers of two. Most floating-point and fixed-point data types consist of numbers that are subsets of dyadic rationals. Due to their simplicity, dyadic rationals are used in exact real computing using interval arithmetic and are central to certain theoretical models of computable numbers.\n\n3. In music: time signatures in western musical notation, which resemble fractions (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, or 6/8), are generally dyadic. Although non-dyadic time signatures exist, traditional notation is primarily based on dyadic fractions.\n\nThese examples illustrate the relevance of dyadic rationals to various aspects of our daily lives, from measurement and computing to music. \n\n<user> Can you simplify the computing application for me? \n\n<assistant> Sure! In computing, dyadic rationals are special because they're easier for computers to work with. They can be written as a simple fraction where the bottom half (called the denominator) is always a power of two, like 1/2, 3/4, or 7/8.\n\nComputers use a special kind of number called \"floating-point\" numbers, which are also based on powers of two. This means that dyadic rationals fit nicely into the way computers handle numbers. So, when computers need to do calculations with fractions, using dyadic rationals makes the task simpler and more efficient. \n\n<user> Can you elaborate on the application of dyadic rationals in music and give some examples? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! In music, dyadic rationals have a notable application in the form of time signatures. Time signatures are used to specify how many beats are in each measure of a piece of music and what type of note gets one beat.\n\nTraditional time signatures in Western music notation often resemble fractions, such as 4/4, 3/4, and 6/8. In these examples, the top number (numerator) shows the number of beats per measure, while the bottom number (denominator) represents the note value that gets one beat. The denominators are generally powers of two: 2 (for half notes), 4 (for quarter notes), 8 (for eighth notes), and so on.\n\nFor example, in a 4/4 time signature (also known as common time), there are four quarter-note beats in each measure. In a 3/4 time signature (often called waltz time), there are three quarter-note beats per measure. Lastly, in a 6/8 time signature, there are six eighth-note beats in each measure.\n\nThough non-dyadic time signatures exist, they are less common in traditional Western music. The majority of time signatures used in classical and popular music are based on dyadic fractions, making dyadic rationals an integral part of musical notation and structure in this context. ",

        "reference": "In mathematics, a dyadic rational or binary rational is a number that can be expressed as a fraction whose denominator is a power of two. For example, 1/2, 3/2, and 3/8 are dyadic rationals, but 1/3 is not. These numbers are important in computer science because they are the only ones with finite binary representations. Dyadic rationals also have applications in weights and measures, musical time signatures, and early mathematics education. They can accurately approximate any real number.\n\nThe sum, difference, or product of any two dyadic rational numbers is another dyadic rational number, given by a simple formula. However, division of one dyadic rational number by another does not always produce a dyadic rational result. Mathematically, this means that the dyadic rational numbers form a ring, lying between the ring of integers and the field of rational numbers. This ring may be denoted .\n\nIn advanced mathematics, the dyadic rational numbers are central to the constructions of the dyadic solenoid, Minkowski's question-mark function, Daubechies wavelets, Thompson's group, Prüfer 2-group, surreal numbers, and fusible numbers. These numbers are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers; they form a subsystem of the 2-adic numbers as well as of the reals, and can represent the fractional parts of 2-adic numbers. Functions from natural numbers to dyadic rationals have been used to formalize mathematical analysis in reverse mathematics.\n\nApplications\n\nIn measurement\n\nMany traditional systems of weights and measures are based on the idea of repeated halving, which produces dyadic rationals when measuring fractional amounts of units. The inch is customarily subdivided in dyadic rationals rather than using a decimal subdivision. The customary divisions of the gallon into half-gallons, quarts, pints, and cups are also dyadic. The ancient Egyptians used dyadic rationals in measurement, with denominators up to 64. Similarly, systems of weights from the Indus Valley Civilisation are for the most part based on repeated halving; anthropologist Heather M.-L. Miller writes that \"halving is a relatively simple operation with beam balances, which is likely why so many weight systems of this time period used binary systems\".\n\nIn computing\nDyadic rationals are central to computer science as a type of fractional number that many computers can manipulate directly. In particular, as a data type used by computers, floating-point numbers are often defined as integers multiplied by positive or negative powers of two. The numbers that can be represented precisely in a floating-point format, such as the IEEE floating-point datatypes, are called its representable numbers. For most floating-point representations, the representable numbers are a subset of the dyadic rationals. The same is true for fixed-point datatypes, which also use powers of two implicitly in the majority of cases. Because of the simplicity of computing with dyadic rationals, they are also used for exact real computing using interval arithmetic, and are central to some theoretical models of computable numbers.\n\nGenerating a random variable from random bits, in a fixed amount of time, is possible only when the variable has finitely many outcomes whose probabilities are all dyadic rational numbers. For random variables whose probabilities are not dyadic, it is necessary either to approximate their probabilities by dyadic rationals, or to use a random generation process whose time is itself random and unbounded.\n\nIn music\n\nTime signatures in Western musical notation traditionally are written in a form resembling fractions (for example: , , or ), although the horizontal line of the musical staff that separates the top and bottom number is usually omitted when writing the signature separately from its staff. As fractions they are generally dyadic, although non-dyadic time signatures have also been used.",

It's usually smaller than three centimeters in diameter, and may occur as a solitary pulmonary nodule (spn) or in multiples.\n\nIn most cases, lung nodules are benign and could represent a granuloma, hamartoma, or other non-cancerous growths. However, in about 20% of cases, they may represent malignant cancer, especially in older adults and smokers.\n\nSeveral factors can help in determining the nature of a lung nodule. These include size, location, margin morphology, presence of multiple nodules, growth rate, presence of emphysema or fibrosis, and characteristics observed in radiological imaging. It's important to follow up with your doctor and possibly conduct further tests to properly assess the nature of the nodule. \n\n<user> What are some common benign causes of lung nodules? i know you mentioned granuloma and hamartoma, but i'm curious if there are other possibilities as well. also, how do the risk factors for incidentally discovered nodules, like size and location, affect the probability of cancer? are there specific signs in radiological imaging that suggest a higher likelihood of malignancy in a pulmonary nodule? \n\n<assistant> Apart from granuloma and hamartoma, various benign causes of lung nodules include infections like tuberculosis, fungal infections (e.g., coccidioidomycosis), lung abscess, pneumonia, and rarer infections like nocardial infection or worm infestations. Immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and organizing pneumonia, can also lead to lung nodules.\n\nSome risk factors affecting the probability of a nodule being cancerous are:\n\n1. Size: larger nodules have a higher risk of cancer.\n2. Location: upper lobe location increases cancer risk, but proximity to fissures or pleura may indicate a benign cause.\n3. Margin morphology: spiculated margins are a risk factor for cancer.\n4. Multiplicity: up to 3 additional nodules increase cancer risk, but 4 or more decreases it.\n5. Growth rate: solid cancers have typical doubling times of 100-400 days while subsolid cancers take 3-5 years.\n6. Presence of emphysema or fibrosis: these are risk factors for cancer.\n\nIn radiological imaging, certain characteristics can suggest a higher likelihood of malignancy, such as spiculations (highly predictive of cancer), pleural retraction, irregular or lobulated margins, and thicker walls in the case of central cavities. However, these factors should be assessed by a medical professional alongside other clinical information to make an accurate determination. \n\n<user> Are there any treatment options or follow-up techniques to monitor lung nodules and help distinguish between benign and malignant growths? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are several follow-up techniques and treatment options that can help monitor lung nodules and differentiate between benign and malignant growths. The course of action primarily depends on the individual's risk factors and the characteristics of the lung nodule.\n\n1. Observation and monitoring: for low-risk patients with small nodules, periodic monitoring with chest x-rays or ct scans may be advised. This helps determine any changes in nodule size or appearance, which could indicate malignancy.\n\n2. Non-invasive imaging: contrast-enhanced ct scans or pet scans can assess factors like enhancement and metabolic activity, which can help differentiate between benign and malignant nodules.\n\n3. Biopsy: if there's a high suspicion of cancer, biopsy techniques such as fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (vats) may be performed to obtain tissue samples for analysis.\n\n4. Surgical resection: for nodules highly suggestive of malignancy or when biopsy is inconclusive, surgical removal may be considered to confirm the diagnosis and remove the potential cancer.\n\n5. Additional tests: blood tests and pulmonary function tests might also be conducted to better understand the individual's overall health and risk factors.\n\nIt's crucial to consult with your doctor to identify the most appropriate approach based on your specific findings and risk factors. They will guide you in determining the best course of action for monitoring and treating the lung nodule. \n\n<user> How common are incidentally discovered lung nodules on chest x-rays and ct scans? \n\n<assistant> Lung nodules are incidentally discovered in a fairly small percentage of chest x-rays and ct scans. One or more lung nodules can be an incidental finding in up to 0.2% of chest x-rays and around 1% of ct scans.\n\nThe higher sensitivity of ct scans compared to chest x-rays means they are more likely to detect small nodules that might otherwise remain unnoticed. However, the vast majority of these incidentally discovered nodules turn out to be benign, representing non-cancerous growths or other medical conditions.\n\nDespite the low incidence rate, it's important to adequately evaluate and follow up on incidentally discovered lung nodules, especially for those who have risk factors for lung cancer, such as a history of smoking, exposure to asbestos, or other carcinogens. Monitoring these nodules and addressing any suspicious findings with appropriate testing and interventions can help ensure early detection and treatment of lung cancer, if present, and can significantly improve the prognosis.\n\nIt is essential to discuss any concerns or findings with your doctor, who can interpret the radiological images and provide a professional assessment, taking into account your medical history, risk factors, and the appearance and characteristics of the nodules.

A solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) or coin lesion, is a mass in the lung smaller than three centimeters in diameter. A pulmonary micronodule has a diameter of less than three millimetres. There may also be multiple nodules.\n\nOne or more lung nodules can be an incidental finding found in up to 0.2% of chest X-rays and around 1% of CT scans.\n\nThe nodule most commonly represents a benign tumor such as a granuloma or hamartoma, but in around 20% of cases it represents a malignant cancer, especially in older adults and smokers. Conversely, 10 to 20% of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed in this way. If the patient has a history of smoking or the nodule is growing, the possibility of cancer may need to be excluded through further radiological studies and interventions, possibly including surgical resection. The prognosis depends on the underlying condition.\n\nCauses\nNot every round spot on a radiological image is a solitary pulmonary nodule: it may be confused with the projection of a structure of the chest wall or skin, such as a nipple, a healing rib fracture or electrocardiographic monitoring.\n\nThe most important cause to exclude is any form of lung cancer, including rare forms such as primary pulmonary lymphoma, carcinoid tumor and a solitary metastasis to the lung (common unrecognised primary tumor sites are melanomas, sarcomas or testicular cancer). Benign tumors in the lung include hamartomas and chondromas.\n\nThe most common benign coin lesion is a granuloma (inflammatory nodule), for example due to tuberculosis or a fungal infection, such as Coccidioidomycosis. Other infectious causes include a lung abscess, pneumonia (including pneumocystis pneumonia) or rarely nocardial infection or worm infection (such as dirofilariasis or dog heartworm infestation). Lung nodules can also occur in immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or organizing pneumonia.\n\nA solitary lung nodule can be found to be an arteriovenous malformation, a hematoma or an infarction zone. It may also be caused by bronchial atresia, sequestration, an inhaled foreign body or pleural plaque.\n\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for incidentally discovered nodules are mainly:\n General risk factors of lung cancer such as exposure to tobacco smoking or other carcinogens such as asbestos and previously diagnosed cancer, respiratory infections, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n Size: larger size confers a higher risk of cancer\n\n Location: Upper lobe location is a risk factor for cancer, while a location close to a fissure or the pleura indicates a benign lymph node, especially if having a triangular shape.\n Margin morphology: a spiculated margin is a risk factor for cancer. Benign causes tend to have a well defined border, whereas lobulated lesions or those with an irregular margin extending into the neighbouring tissue tend to be malignant. In particular, spiculations are highly predictive of malignancy with a positive predictive value up to 90%.  Also, a \"notch sign\", which is an abrupt indentation of the nodule, increases the risk of cancer, but may also be found in granulomatous diseases.\n\n Multiplicity: Where the presence of up to an additional 3 nodules has been found to increase the risk of cancer, but decrease in case of 4 or more additional ones, likely because it indicates a previous granulomatous infection rather than cancer.\n Growth rate: solid cancers generally doubles in volume over between 100 and 400 days, while subsolid cancers (generally representing adenocarcinomas) generally doubles in volume over 3 to 5 years. One volume doubling equals approximately a 26% increase in diameter.\n Presence of emphysema and/or fibrosis is a risk factor for cancer. In comparison, the typical size doubling are less than 20 days for infections, and more than 400 days for benign nodules.\n Enhancement: If the exam is done as a combined non-contrast and contrast CT, a solitary nodule with an enhancement off less than 15 Hounsfield units (HU), whereas a higher enhancement indicates a malignant tumor (with a sensitivity estimated at 98%).\n Areas of fatty tissue (−40 to −120 HU) indicates a hamartoma. However, only about 50% of hamartomas are fat containing.\n If there is a central cavity, then a thin wall points to a benign cause whereas a thick wall is associated with malignancy (especially 4 mm or less versus 16 mm or more).\n\n In case of calcifications, a popcorn-like appearance indicates a hamartoma, which is benign.\n In case of subsolid nodules, being part solid has a higher risk of cancer than being purely ground glass opacity.\n\n Pleural retraction is far more common in cancers.",

He earned an undergraduate degree with honors in civil engineering.\n\nProfessional career\nAllegre was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1983 NFL Draft, where he had to go through a try out session. On August 23, he was traded to the Baltimore Colts, in exchange for a ninth round draft choice (#232-John Hunt).\n\nAs a rookie, he made 30 field goals (franchise record) out of 35 attempts and 22 out of 24 extra points, for an 85.7% average (franchise record) and a total of 112 points (franchise record). He tied a franchise record by making 5 field goals against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 1984, he missed 3 preseason games with a bruised heel. He injured a hamstring in the season opener and missed the next 4 contests, only appearing in 12 games. Dean Biasucci replaced him from the second to the sixth game and would remain as a kickoff specialist for the rest of the season.

The content of the book seems to draw from historical events and the challenges faced by the jewish people during their exile. The author focuses on theological reflections, attempts to provide consolation, and encourages the community with hopes for restoration.\n\nSpecifically, the author reflects on israel's history and how the exile resulted from disobedience to god. Through confession of sins, prayers for mercy, and contemplation on wisdom, the author emphasizes the importance of turning back to god and maintaining faith.\n\nAnother possible influence on the book's composition is the maccabean period, which was a time of political and religious struggle in jewish history. Considering the themes of the book, it's likely that the author was influenced by the events, religious fervor, and spiritual aspirations of this era.\n\nIn addition to historical events, the author might also have been influenced by other biblical texts, especially those written by the prophet jeremiah, since the book mentions the connection to jeremiah's scribe, baruch ben neriah. The writer might have sought to connect the concerns and experiences of the displaced jewish people to their broader scriptural tradition. \n\n<user> I am curious about the structure and the main themes of the book of baruch. could you provide more details on those aspects? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The book of baruch has a distinct structure that's organized around specific themes. Here's a breakdown of its basic outline, along with the themes addressed in each section:\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–14): the author introduces the words of baruch written in babylonia, and the people's reaction to it, which involves weeping, fasting, and praying before the lord.\n\n2. Confession of sins (1:15–2:10): this section acknowledges god's justice in bringing hardships upon the people as a result of their disobedience, and admits to not heeding his voice.\n\n3. Prayer for mercy (2:11–3:8): the author pleads for god's mercy, noting that the dead cannot give glory and justice to the lord (this connects to psalms 6:6/5).\n\n4. A paean for wisdom (3:9–4:14): this hymn venerates wisdom and questions the value of earthly treasures that people trust, emphasizing the eventual downfall of those who hoard material wealth.\n\n5. Baruch's poem of consolation (4:5–5:9): this poem contains messages for those in captivity, \"neighbors of zion,\" and jerusalem. It explains that the people have been sold to gentiles, not for destruction, but as a consequence of provoking god's wrath. Throughout the poem, themes of hope, restoration, and faith are conveyed.\n\nThe book of baruch's main themes include confession, prayer for mercy, wisdom, hope, consolation, and faith in god. It serves to connect the past and present experiences of the jewish people and emphasizes the importance of returning to god and keeping the faith during challenging times. ",

In Judaism and Protestant Christianity, it is considered not to be part of the canon, with the Protestant Bibles categorizing it as part of the Biblical apocrypha. The book is named after Baruch ben Neriah, Jeremiah's well-known scribe, who is mentioned at Baruch 1:1, and has been presumed to be the author of the whole work. The book is a reflection of a late Jewish writer on the circumstances of Jewish exiles from Babylon, with meditations on the theology and history of Israel, discussions of wisdom, and a direct address to residents of Jerusalem and the Diaspora. Some scholars propose that it was written during or shortly after the period of the Maccabees.\n\nThe Book of Baruch is sometimes referred to as 1 Baruch to distinguish it from 2 Baruch, 3 Baruch and 4 Baruch.\n\nAlthough the earliest known manuscripts of Baruch are in Greek, linguistic features of the first parts of Baruch (1:1–3:8) have been proposed as indicating a translation from a Semitic language.\n\nAlthough not in the Hebrew Bible, it is found in the Septuagint, in the Eritrean/Ethiopian Orthodox Bible, and also in Theodotion's Greek version. In 80-book Protestant Bibles, the Book of Baruch is a part of the Biblical apocrypha. Jerome excluded both the Book of Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah from the Vulgate Bible, but both works were introduced into Latin Vulgate Bibles sporadically from the 9th century onwards; and were incorporated into the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate edition.  In the Vulgate it is grouped with the books of the prophets such as the major prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel), and the Twelve Minor Prophets. In the Vulgate, the King James Bible Apocrypha, and many other versions, the Letter of Jeremiah is appended to the end of the Book of Baruch as a sixth chapter; in the Septuagint and Orthodox Bibles chapter 6 is usually counted as a separate book, called the Letter or Epistle of Jeremiah.\n\nBasic structure \nThe basic outline of the book of Baruch:\n1:1–14 Introduction: \"And these are the words...which Baruch...wrote in Babylonia....

He attended crockett vocational tech in detroit, a school that didn't have a proper locker room for its football team before his senior season. Despite that, he made a significant impact on the team's performance.\n\nGraham was expected to make an immediate impact upon joining the football team's starting lineup as a sophomore, and he earned an honorable mention as a lineman for the 2003 all-detroit selection by the detroit news. He played various positions in his junior year, including linebacker, offensive guard, placekicker, and punter.\n\nLeading his team to the mhsaa state championships, he was one of three juniors named to the 2004 first-team all-detroit team. His performance included recording 91 tackles (20 for a loss) while maintaining a 3.8-grade point average. In one game, he had twelve tackles, four sacks, four forced fumbles, two blocked punts, and scored on a 78-yard fake punt.\n\nGraham was ranked as the top class of 2006 high school football prospect in the state of michigan and the number two inside linebacker prospect by rivals.com. He also ranked as the third-best linebacker in the nation by scout.com. Espn and recruiting analyst tom lemming recognized him as the number two inside linebacker and the best high school linebacker in the country, respectively.\n\nDuring his senior season, he was considered the best high school football player in the state of michigan. He also played tight end and fullback while missing four weeks due to a knee injury. He was captain of the east team at the u.s. Army all-american bowl and recorded four tackles and a blocked field goal in that game.\n\nGraham was a finalist for the parade all-america high school player of the year award and the walter payton trophy. He was selected for the associated press first-team class b all-state team and earned various other accolades in his high school career. Despite this, he violated state rules by participating in an out-of-state all-star game and had to surrender his high school athletic eligibility for the winter and spring seasons. \n\n<user> How did brandon graham perform during his college football career at michigan? \n\n<assistant> Brandon graham had a remarkable college football career at the university of michigan. As a defensive end for the michigan wolverines football team, he accumulated impressive statistics and earned several awards during this period.\n\nIn 2009, he was the big ten conference co-mvp, recognized by the chicago tribune silver football award. He led the big ten conference in tackles for a loss (tfls) in both 2008 and 2009, with 20 tfls in 11 games in 2008, and 26 tfls in 12 games in 2009. Additionally, he was ranked the 2009 fbs tackles (tfls) for a loss (per game) champion after finishing second in 2008 by 0.1 tfl per game.\n\nGraham's performance over his college career resulted in a total of 29.5 sacks and 56 career tfls for the wolverines football team. His efforts earned him second-team 2008 big ten all-conference recognition from both the coaches and the media. \n\nIn 2009, he was a finalist for the ncaa division i fbs football hendricks award, which is given to the top defensive end in college football. He was also a first-team 2009 all-big ten selection by both coaches and media. Graham received national recognition in various first-team and second-team all-america lists from different publications.\n\nFurthermore, brandon graham was named mvp of the 2010 senior bowl, a college football all-star game that helps showcase players for the upcoming nfl draft. His college career solidified him as a top prospect heading into the nfl. \n\n<user> What were the significant accomplishments of his career with the philadelphia eagles? \n\n<assistant> Since being drafted in the first round of the 2010 nfl draft by the philadelphia eagles, brandon graham has had a productive career with the team, achieving several significant accomplishments as a defensive end.\n\nOne of the defining moments in graham's nfl career was the super bowl lii, played on february 4, 2018. The philadelphia eagles won their first super bowl title, defeating the new england patriots 41-33. Brandon graham played a crucial role in the game, where he made a game-changing play by strip-sacking new england's quarterback, tom brady, with just over two minutes left on the clock. This play helped the eagles secure their victory in the championship game.\n\nIn the 2017 season, graham had a career year when he recorded a personal best of 9.5 sacks in the regular season. He also earned pro football focus' (pff) no. 9 overall pass-rushing grade (86.0), tied for sixth in total pressures with 70, and tied for seventh in defensive stops with 37. That performance led to his selection to the 2017 pro bowl roster as an alternate.\n\nThroughout his career with the eagles, brandon graham has been well-regarded for his relentless motor, strong work ethic, and excellent skills as a pass rusher and run defender. He's also been a consistent performer and leader for the team's defense over the years.\n\nThough he experienced setbacks in his early years in the nfl due to injuries, which limited his playing time and impact, graham has since become a vital component of the eagles' defense. His achievements and contributions to the team have made him a fan favorite among philadelphia eagles supporters. \n\n<user> How did his transition from being a linebacker in high school to a defensive end in college and the nfl happen? \n\n<assistant> The transition of brandon graham from a linebacker in high school to a defensive end in college and the nfl happened due to a combination of factors, including weight gain, skill set, and coaching decisions.\n\nFollowing his high school football career, graham participated in the u.s. Army all-american bowl, violating michigan state rules about participating in out-of-state all-star games. As a consequence, he lost his high school athletic eligibility for the winter and spring seasons. During this period without athletics, he overate and added 40 pounds (18 kg) to his frame. This weight gain played a significant role in the transition from linebacker to defensive end.\n\nWhen graham joined the university of michigan's football team, the coaching staff felt that his heavier weight and skill set would be better suited for the defensive end position. In this role, he could use his size, strength, and pass-rushing ability more effectively. As brandon lost the excess weight and adapted to his new position, he realized he could excel in that role at a lighter weight.\n\nIn the nfl, the philadelphia eagles, recognizing his potential as a defensive end, drafted him in the first round. They had confidence in his ability to continue developing his skills at that position. Graham's tenacity, technique, and outstanding work ethic have since contributed to his successful transition from a high school linebacker to an nfl defensive end.\n\nThis kind of positional change is not uncommon in football, as players often experience changes in their roles based on physical development, skill sets, and team needs at the college or professional level. Brandon graham's journey illustrates his adaptability and commitment to excelling on the field, regardless of the position he plays. ",

It is the first theory to achieve full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity. Qed describes phenomena involving electrically charged particles and their interaction through the exchange of photons, which are particles of electromagnetic radiation. It is the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism, covering all aspects of matter and light interaction.\n\nQed is considered as a perturbation theory of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum. It was famously referred to as \"the jewel of physics\" by richard feynman due to its ability to predict extremely accurate quantities, such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the lamb shift of hydrogen's energy levels.\n\nThe development of qed is attributed to paul dirac in the 1920s and includes contributions from other prominent physicists like wolfgang pauli, eugene wigner, pascual jordan, werner heisenberg, and enrico fermi. Renormalization, a technique that removes the infinities in the theory, played a significant role in attaining fully covariant formulations. Qed has served as a foundational template for other quantum field theories, such as quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak force theory. \n\n<user> Renormalization technique more? \n\n<assistant> Renormalization is a mathematical procedure that allows certain divergences, or infinities, arising in quantum field theory calculations to be managed in a systematic way. These infinities can appear when particles interact at very high energies or short distances. Without renormalization, these infinities would make the results of calculations physically meaningless and undermine the consistency of the theory itself.\n\nHans bethe was the first to suggest a way to address this issue. He figured out that by associating the infinities with certain physical quantities, like mass and charge, it was possible to absorb them into constants that could be fixed by experiments. As a result, physicists could obtain finite and experimentally consistent results.\n\nLater on, sin-itiro tomonaga, julian schwinger, richard feynman, and freeman dyson developed more sophisticated renormalization techniques, leading to consistent predictions with qed at any order of perturbation theory. This transformed qed into the basis for other quantum field theories that include interactions between fundamental particles.\n\nDespite renormalization's success in practice, some physicists, like feynman, expressed concerns regarding its mathematical validity. Nonetheless, renormalization has become a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, serving as a criterion for a theory's acceptability in modern physics. \n\n<user> How did qed influence the development of other quantum field theories? \n\n<assistant> Quantum electrodynamics (qed) established groundbreaking approaches and techniques that formed the basis for the development of other quantum field theories. Its successful renormalization, covariant formulation, and gauge invariance served as useful models for subsequent theories.\n\nOne of the theories influenced by qed is quantum chromodynamics (qcd), which explains the force between quarks and gluons, the building blocks of nuclear particles like protons and neutrons. Qcd was developed in the early 1960s and reached its current form in 1975 with the works of h. David politzer, sidney coleman, david gross, and frank wilczek.\n\nMoreover, qed played a crucial role in the unification of the weak nuclear force and electromagnetic force into a single consolidated force known as the electroweak force. Sheldon glashow, steven weinberg, and abdus salam independently demonstrated how the weak nuclear force and qed could be merged, building on the works of schwinger, gerald guralnik, dick hagen, tom kibble, peter higgs, jeffrey goldstone, and others.\n\nOverall, by providing a consistent theoretical framework for explaining the behavior and interactions of charged particles and photons, qed laid the foundation for future developments in particle physics. The mathematical tools and insights gained from qed have been instrumental in formulating and refining the theories that describe other fundamental forces in nature. ",

In essence , it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved . QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction . \n\n In technical terms , QED can be described as a perturbation theory of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum . Richard Feynman called it \" the jewel of physics \" for its extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the Lamb shift of the energy levels of hydrogen . \n\n = = History = = \n\n The first formulation of a quantum theory describing radiation and matter interaction is attributed to British scientist Paul Dirac , who ( during the 1920s ) was able to compute the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an atom . \n\n Dirac described the quantization of the electromagnetic field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators with the introduction of the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles . In the following years , with contributions from Wolfgang Pauli , Eugene Wigner , Pascual Jordan , Werner Heisenberg and an elegant formulation of quantum electrodynamics due to Enrico Fermi , physicists came to believe that , in principle , it would be possible to perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles . However , further studies by Felix Bloch with Arnold Nordsieck , and Victor Weisskopf , in 1937 and 1939 , revealed that such computations were reliable only at a first order of perturbation theory , a problem already pointed out by Robert Oppenheimer . At higher orders in the series infinities emerged , making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on the internal consistency of the theory itself . With no solution for this problem known at the time , it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between special relativity and quantum mechanics . \n\n Difficulties with the theory increased through the end of 1940 . Improvements in microwave technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom , now known as the Lamb shift and magnetic moment of the electron . These experiments unequivocally exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain . \n\n A first indication of a possible way out was given by Hans Bethe . In 1947 , while he was traveling by train to reach Schenectady from New York , after giving a talk at the conference at Shelter Island on the subject , Bethe completed the first non @-@ relativistic computation of the shift of the lines of the hydrogen atom as measured by Lamb and Retherford . Despite the limitations of the computation , agreement was excellent . The idea was simply to attach infinities to corrections of mass and charge that were actually fixed to a finite value by experiments . In this way , the infinities get absorbed in those constants and yield a finite result in good agreement with experiments . This procedure was named renormalization . \n\n Based on Bethe 's intuition and fundamental papers on the subject by Sin @-@ Itiro Tomonaga , Julian Schwinger , Richard Feynman and Freeman Dyson , it was finally possible to get fully covariant formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics . Sin @-@ Itiro Tomonaga , Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman were jointly awarded with a Nobel prize in physics in 1965 for their work in this area . Their contributions , and those of Freeman Dyson , were about covariant and gauge invariant formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of perturbation theory . Feynman 's mathematical technique , based on his diagrams , initially seemed very different from the field @-@ theoretic , operator @-@ based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga , but Freeman Dyson later showed that the two approaches were equivalent . Renormalization , the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through integrals , has subsequently become one of the fundamental aspects of quantum field theory and has come to be seen as a criterion for a theory 's general acceptability . Even though renormalization works very well in practice , Feynman was never entirely comfortable with its mathematical validity , even referring to renormalization as a \" shell game \" and \" hocus pocus \" . \n\n QED has served as the model and template for all subsequent quantum field theories . One such subsequent theory is quantum chromodynamics , which began in the early 1960s and attained its present form in the 1975 work by H. David Politzer , Sidney Coleman , David Gross and Frank Wilczek . Building on the pioneering work of Schwinger , Gerald Guralnik , Dick Hagen , and Tom Kibble , Peter Higgs , Jeffrey Goldstone , and others , Sheldon Glashow , Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force . \n\n = = Feynman 's view of quantum electrodynamics = = \n\n = = = Introduction = = = \n\n Near the end of his life , Richard P. Feynman gave a series of lectures on QED intended for the lay public . These lectures were transcribed and published as Feynman ( 1985 ) , QED : The strange theory of light and matter , a classic non @-@ mathematical exposition of QED from the point of view articulated below . \n\n The key components of Feynman 's presentation of QED are three basic actions . \n\n A photon goes from one place and time to another place and time . \n\n",

The universities and colleges christian fellowship (uccf) is a uk-based charity that was founded in 1928 as the inter-varsity fellowship of evangelical unions. Its dual aims are to advance the evangelical christian faith among students, graduates, and former university members and to promote biblical scholarship and research.\n\nTo achieve these goals, uccf has three main areas of activity. First, they encourage and support leaders of affiliated christian unions (cus) throughout the uk in engaging in evangelism and helping christian students grow in their faith. There are currently around 200 christian unions with approximately 20,000 members, and nearly 40,000 students attend outreach events each year.

This ultimately led to a split and the formation of the modern uccf and scm.\n\nUccf's current objectives, for example in 2008, are focused on supporting christian students and outreach activities.

These christian unions provide opportunities for fellowship, bible study, and evangelism, with nearly 40,000 students attending outreach events every year. The activities offered by christian unions may vary depending on the specific group, but they generally aim to create a welcoming and supportive environment for christian students to grow in their faith, learn about the bible, and share their beliefs with others.\n\nTo support christian unions, uccf employs about 80 staff and has approximately 80 volunteer \"relay workers\" who participate in a one-year training program. Many of these staff members and volunteers have been involved in christian unions as undergraduates themselves. They support the student christian unions by providing training, advice, and materials to help them in their evangelism efforts and their mission to nurture christian students in their faith journey.\n\nIn addition to staff and volunteer support, uccf also publishes and distributes a wide range of christian resources through its inter-varsity press (ivp) subsidiary based in nottingham. These resources include books, study materials, and multimedia content that can be used by christian unions to enhance their activities and engage their members.\n\nBy collaborating with affiliated christian unions, uccf supports their evangelism and discipleship initiatives, helping students grow in their faith and deepen their understanding of the bible. Uccf also organizes events and conferences for cu leaders and members, further enabling them to share experiences, learn from one another, and develop their skills in leadership, evangelism, and christian ministry. \n\n<user> How does uccf promote biblical research and scholarship, and what are some institutes or organizations they are associated with for this purpose? \n\n<assistant> Uccf promotes biblical research and scholarship primarily by supporting those engaged in these areas, especially at the postgraduate level. They are closely associated with tyndale house, cambridge, which was founded in 1944. Tyndale house is a renowned research institute that provides resources, library facilities, and a scholarly community for those pursuing biblical and theological research.\n\nAnother institute previously connected with uccf was the whitefield institute in oxford, founded by e. David cook. This institute provided support for those involved in christian ethics research. In the summer of 2006, the whitefield institute was reconstituted and became the kirby laing institute for christian ethics.\n\nBy partnering with these organizations and promoting research in biblical studies and christian ethics, uccf helps advance the scholarship in these fields, encouraging a deeper understanding of the bible and its teachings. \n\n<user> I'm curious about the doctrinal basis of uccf. can you please elaborate on the fundamental truths of christianity they believe in? for instance, their view on god's sovereignty, human sinfulness, and jesus christ's atoning sacrifice to redeem humankind. additionally, can you discuss the role of the holy scripture in their doctrine? \n\n<assistant> Uccf's doctrinal basis is centered on conservative evangelical christianity and outlines the fundamental truths of christianity as revealed in the holy scripture. Their core beliefs include:\n\n1. There is one god in three persons: the father, the son, and the holy spirit. This expresses their belief in the trinity, which is the unity and coexistence of god as three distinct persons, yet being one god.\n\n2. God's sovereignty extends to creation, revelation, redemption, and final judgment. They acknowledge god as having supreme authority and control over all aspects of existence, including the creation of the universe, revealing his will and purpose to humanity, providing salvation through jesus christ, and enacting a final judgment on humankind.\n\n3. They believe in the infallibility and inspiration of the bible as originally given, considering it the supreme authority in all matters of belief and behavior. This underlines the importance of the scripture as the final and ultimate source of truth and guidance for christians.\n\n4. They hold that, since the fall of humanity due to sin, all humans are sinful and guilty. This leads to everyone being subject to god's wrath and condemnation, emphasizing the inherent sinfulness and the inability of humans to save themselves.\n\n5. Jesus christ is central to their belief, as they affirm his divinity, birth from a virgin, sinless humanity, death on the cross, bodily resurrection, and current reign over heaven and earth. Jesus is the incarnate son of god in their doctrine.\n\n6. Redemption from the guilt, penalty, and power of sin comes exclusively through the sacrificial death of jesus christ, who acts as humanity's representative and substitute. He is the only mediator between people and god. This highlights the crucial role of jesus christ's atoning sacrifice in providing salvation and forgiveness for human sins.\n\nUccf's doctrinal basis emphasizes the importance of a biblically-informed understanding of christianity and ensures that its affiliated christian unions share a common set of beliefs rooted in the holy scripture. It guides their mission to advance evangelical christianity and promote biblical scholarship and research. ",

Many of these staff and volunteers are graduates who were involved in the CU as undergraduates. They support the student Christian Unions with training, advice and materials.\n\nHistory\nIn the summer term of 1919 Norman Grubb (an evangelical student at Trinity College, Cambridge) and a friend met with ten representatives of the Student Christian Movement (SCM) to discuss their concerns that SCM was promoting an overly liberal view of Christianity in the British universities. Grubb posed the direct question, \"Does the Student Christian Movement put the atoning blood of Christ central in its teaching?\" After a little deliberation the answer came, \"Well, we acknowledge it, but not necessarily [as] central.\"\n\nGrubb and his friends at Cambridge decided that they could no longer work in partnership with SCM, saying that it had divorced a biblically-based, cross-centred emphasis.  Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union (CICCU) had been disaffiliated from national SCM since 1910, but only after talks in 1919 floundered did a permanent split look probable. Splits followed throughout the British and Irish university system, and two separate organisations emerged which went on to form the modern UCCF (initially known as the IVF) and SCM.\n\nCICCU parted from SCM over two issues. For Grubb and his friends, the Bible had to be the central source of truth, but SCM could not affirm that its entire membership matched their view of Biblical infallibility. The second area of difference was the priority of evangelism; although the SCM had initially aimed at \"the evangelisation of the world in this generation\", CICCU members felt that this aim was not being sufficiently emphasised by 1922. SCM's official history also refers to differences over governance.\n\nGrubb developed a vision of seeing an \"evangelical witnessing community on every university campus\". (At the time just 28 universities operated in the UK and Ireland.)\n\nMeanwhile, in 1919, students from Oxford, Cambridge and London CUs started to meet in London for non-residential conferences.  After being persuaded to take on the secretaryship of these Inter-Varsity Conferences in 1924, King's College alumnus Dr Douglas Johnson was chosen by delegates from the 14 university Christian unions who assembled at High Leigh Conference Centre, Hoddesdon in 1928 to found the Inter-Varsity Fellowship of Evangelical Unions (IVF) as its first General Secretary, a role in which he continued until 1964. The Inter-Varsity Fellowship was the first unifying conservative evangelical body.\n\nIn 1947 UCCF became a founding member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES), through which it continues to play an active role in international mission.\n\nDuring the 1940s, CU work began in the Technical Colleges under a subsidiary body, the Inter-Colleges Christian Fellowship (ICCF), and this saw substantial growth with the formation of polytechnics, as a consequence of the increase in full-time students in that sector. Alongside this, the Colleges of Education Christian Unions (CECU) provided a similar function, supporting Christian Unions based in teacher-training colleges.  Work in these areas expanded rapidly in the late 1960s and early 1970s, such that by the mid-1970s it represented half the ministry, and resulted in ICCF and CECU merging with IVF to form the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship. A specialist group, the Religious and Theological Students Fellowship (RTSF), who published the journal Themelios, retained a separate identity.\n\nSince then many colleges have themselves gained university status. Until 2007 UCCF continued to serve both the HE and FE sectors of tertiary education, but in that year a new organisation called FESTIVE – FE & Sixth Form Initiative came into being,\nleaving UCCF free to concentrate on HE.\n\nKey staff\n Douglas Johnson, Secretary, 1928–64\n Oliver R.

This structure helps manage funds in different currencies efficiently and without acquiring foreign exchange risk.\n\nAn fx swap has two legs: a spot transaction and a forward transaction. These are executed simultaneously for the same quantity and offset each other. The spot transaction is typically agreed upon within the same week, while the forward transaction is based on a future date. A forward-forward transaction is also possible, where neither leg is a spot transaction.\n\nThe most common use of foreign exchange swaps is for institutions to fund their foreign exchange balances. Once a foreign exchange transaction settles, the holder is left with a positive (or \"long\") position in one currency and a negative (or \"short\") position in another. Institutions close out any foreign balances and re-institute them for the following day using \"tom-next\" swaps. The interest collected or paid every night is known as the cost of carry, and specific trades based on this are referred to as carry trades.\n\nCompanies may also use foreign exchange swaps to avoid foreign exchange risk. For example, a british company with sales in europe and expenses in britain may create a 1-month swap to manage the currencies efficiently while avoiding fx risk. They would sell eur and buy gbp on spot while simultaneously buying eur and selling gbp on a 1-month forward.\n\nPricing of fx swaps is based on the relationship between spot and forward rates, known as interest rate parity. The forward points, or swap points, are quoted as the difference between forward and spot rates and are approximately proportional to the interest rate differential.\n\nForeign exchange swaps should not be confused with currency swaps, which are rarer long-term transactions governed by different rules. \n\n<user> I'm interested in the example you mentioned about the british company. can you walk me through each step of the swap and explain how it helps them manage currencies and reduce risk? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Let's break down the steps of the foreign exchange swap for the british company:\n\n1. The british company has sales in europe, so they receive payments in eur. However, their primary operations are in britain, and they need gbp to cover expenses.\n\n2. The company knows that they will need to pay their manufacturers in europe in 1 month. One option would be to spot sell their eur and buy gbp to cover their expenses in britain now, and then spot buy eur and sell gbp to pay their business partners in europe in 1 month. But this exposes them to foreign exchange risk, as the eur/gbp exchange rate could move against them.\n\n3. To reduce this risk, the company decides to create a 1-month foreign exchange swap. In the first leg of the swap, they sell eur and buy gbp on the spot market. This allows them to cover their immediate expenses in britain.\n\n4. Simultaneously, in the second leg of the swap, they agree to buy eur and sell gbp on a 1-month forward contract. This ensures that they will have the necessary amount of eur to pay their european partners in 1 month, regardless of any fluctuations in the eur/gbp exchange rate.\n\nThrough this foreign exchange swap, the british company can manage their currencies more efficiently and protect themselves from potential losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n<user> That was a helpful walkthrough, thank you. i also noticed you mentioned \"tom-next\" swaps in your initial explanation. could you elaborate on how these swaps work and why institutions use them to manage their foreign exchange balances? \n\n<assistant> Tom-next swaps are a specific type of foreign exchange swap used by institutions to manage their foreign exchange balances on a daily basis. Tom-next stands for \"tomorrow-next day,\" referring to the short-term nature of these swaps.\n\nHere's how tom-next swaps work:\n\n1. At the end of every day, institutions with foreign exchange balances need to close out any foreign balances.\n\n2. To do this, they use tom-next swaps, buying (or selling) a foreign amount settling tomorrow and then doing the opposite, selling (or buying) it back settling the day after.\n\n3. The purpose of this swap is to collect or pay any overnight interest due on the foreign balances, which is known as the cost of carry.\n\nInstitutions use tom-next swaps to manage their foreign exchange balances because these swaps allow them to temporarily close out their currency positions overnight without exposing them to significant foreign exchange risk. The short-term nature of tom-next swaps makes them an efficient tool for daily management of currency positions, allowing institutions to collect or pay overnight interest as needed, and facilitating carry trades, which are based on expected daily interest gains or costs.

It permits companies that have funds in different currencies to manage them efficiently.\n\nStructure\nA foreign exchange swap has two legs - a spot transaction and a forward transaction - that are executed simultaneously for the same quantity, and therefore offset each other. Forward foreign exchange transactions occur if both companies have a currency the other needs. It prevents negative foreign exchange risk for either party. Foreign exchange spot transactions are similar to forward foreign exchange transactions in terms of how they are agreed upon; however, they are planned for a specific date in the very near future, usually within the same week.\n\nIt is also common to trade \"forward-forward\" transactions, where the first leg is not a spot transaction, but already a forward date.\n\nUses\n\nThe most common  use of foreign exchange swaps is for institutions to fund their foreign exchange balances.\n\nOnce a foreign exchange transaction settles, the holder is left with a positive (or \"long\") position in one currency and a negative (or \"short\") position in another.

If Britain has financial trouble and the EUR/GBP exchange rate moves against them, they may have to spend a lot more GBP to get the same amount of EUR.\n\nTherefore they create a 1 month swap, where they Sell EUR and Buy GBP on spot and simultaneously buy EUR and sell GBP on a 1 month (1M) forward. This significantly reduces their risk. The company knows they will be able to purchase EUR reliably while still being able to use currency for domestic transactions in the interim.\n\nPricing\n\nThe relationship between spot and forward is known as the interest rate parity, which states that\n\nwhere\n F = forward rate\n S = spot rate\n rd = simple interest rate of the term currency\n rf = simple interest rate of the base currency\n T = tenor (calculated according to the appropriate day count convention)\n\nThe forward points or swap points are quoted as the difference between forward and spot, F - S, and is expressed as the following:\n\nif  is small.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Plot of the 1995 film ghost in the shell? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Ghost in the shell is a science fiction anime film set in the year 2029, where the world is interconnected by a vast electronic network. The story follows major motoko kusanagi, an assault team leader for the public security section 9, who is tasked with capturing a mysterious hacker known as the puppet master.\n\nThe pursuit of the puppet master leads kusanagi and her team, batou and ishikawa, to a garbageman who has been \"ghost-hacked\" by the puppet master into believing he was trying to find his daughter. The team arrests the garbageman and the person who provided the program, only to discover that their memories were either erased or implanted.\n\nLater, a facility is hacked to create a female cybernetic body that turns out to have a human \"ghost\" inside, suspected to be the puppet master. Section 9 investigates, while rival agency section 6 claims the body was made to lure and trap the puppet master. Kusanagi decides to \"dive\" into the body to confront the puppet master.\n\nThis leads to a complex web of political intrigue and conspiracy surrounding a secret project called project 2501. The puppet master, who was created by section 6 for hacking purposes, becomes sentient and seeks to merge with kusanagi's ghost to experience mortality. Events escalate as section 6 attempts to destroy all evidence of project 2501, culminating in a dramatic showdown where the puppet master merges with kusanagi, and snipers damage both kusanagi and batou. \n\n<user> How does the self-identity theme fit into the plot of the film? \n\n<assistant> The theme of self-identity is central to the plot of ghost in the shell, as it explores the existential questions that arise in a technologically advanced society where the lines between humans and machines become blurred.\n\nThe primary exploration of this theme is through the character of major motoko kusanagi, who possesses a cybernetic body, or \"shell.\" as she ponders her existence and the nature of the \"ghost\" within her – the essence of her humanity, she grapples with what it truly means to be human, and how a cybernetic body impacts her self-identity.\n\nThe film also delves into the concept of interconnectedness and its implications on self-identity. Characters like the garbageman and the puppet master's shell have their memories tampered with, which makes them question their own reality and the nature of their identities. This raises questions about the reliability of memories and the need to preserve them as part of an individual's identity.\n\nThe most poignant exploration of self-identity comes through the puppet master, an ai that achieved sentience and begins to contemplate its existence. Troubled by the lack of ability to reproduce or die, the puppet master seeks to merge with kusanagi's ghost in order to experience a form of mortality. This merging of two consciousnesses, or \"ghosts,\" blurs the lines between individual identities, further questioning the concept of self within a rapidly changing technological landscape.\n\nThroughout the film, characters face moral and existential dilemmas related to their self-identity and the implications of advanced technology on their understanding of what it means to be human. Ghost in the shell pushes viewers to consider the ever-evolving definition of identity, as the distinction between man and machine becomes increasingly complex in an interconnected world. \n\n<user> What was groundbreaking about the film's visuals and its influence on other filmmakers? \n\n<assistant> When ghost in the shell was released in 1995, it was widely lauded for its groundbreaking visuals that showcased a remarkable synthesis of traditional cel animation and computer-generated imagery (cgi). This innovative blend pushed the boundaries of what was possible with animation, and the result was a cinematic experience that was visually captivating and immersive, effectively bringing the cyberpunk universe to life.\n\nThe film's detailed backgrounds and distinct character designs, combined with the meticulous blending of 2d and 3d elements, created a hyper-realistic and evocative world. This combination of artistic styles allowed for seamless transitions between scenes and an incredible depth of field, contributing to the movie's unique visual language, which has influenced numerous artists and filmmakers since its release.\n\nNotably, the wachowskis, creators of the matrix trilogy, cited ghost in the shell as a major inspiration for their work. The film's slick action sequences, its portrayal of a computer-simulated reality, and the exploration of the nature of human consciousness provided a thematic and visual blueprint for the matrix. This inspiration becomes evident when comparing certain scenes from both movies, like the iconic \"bullet-time\" effect or the use of green-tinted digital rain.\n\nGhost in the shell's impact on the visual style of future sci-fi films is undeniable, as it has inspired iconic filmmakers to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in cinematic storytelling. Its innovation in blending traditional animation and cgi continues to influence new generations of animators and filmmakers. \n\n<user> What other versions of ghost in the shell have been released since the original film? \n\n<assistant> Several iterations of ghost in the shell have been produced since the release of the original 1995 film. In 2004, mamoru oshii directed ghost in the shell 2: innocence. Although it is not a direct sequel, innocence further explores the themes and philosophies of the original while following the character batou as the main protagonist.\n\nIn 2008, oshii released ghost in the shell 2.0, an updated version of the original film featuring new audio and updated 3d animation. This edition retained the core story and visuals from the original, but incorporated the advancements in animation technology that had developed since the first film's release.\n\nThere's also a live-action hollywood adaptation of ghost in the shell, released in 2017. Directed by rupert sanders, the film starred scarlett johansson as major motoko kusanagi. Although the live-action adaptation provided stunning visuals and action sequences, it received mixed reviews, with some critics contending that it lacked the depth and impact of the original animated film.\n\nAdditionally, various anime television series, such as ghost in the shell: stand alone complex and ghost in the shell: arise, have expanded the universe by adapting and exploring the source material. Each of these adaptations approaches the themes and world of ghost in the shell in its own unique way but remains connected to the core concepts of the original film. \n\n<user> What language was used in the music composed for the film's climax? \n\n<assistant> The music composed for the climax of ghost in the shell was created by kenji kawai. For a key piece leading up to the film's climax, kawai made use of an ancient japanese language in a wedding song. The haunting melody sets the tone for the emotional revelation and the intense action sequence that follows, immersing viewers in the complex and futuristic world of the film. The score is highly regarded as an integral part of the movie's atmosphere, effectively evoking feelings of both wonder and introspection throughout the narrative. ",

Explicit curriculum: this refers to the subjects that are intentionally taught, such as math, science, and history. It includes the specific content, knowledge, and skills that the school intends for its students to acquire. The explicit curriculum aligns with the school's instructional goals and mission. \n\n2.

A national curriculum sets standards for what students are expected to learn in various subjects and establishes the overall objectives of the education system.\n\nOne benefit of a national curriculum is that it helps ensure consistency in the quality and content of education. By having a shared set of standards, schools and teachers can work cohesively towards a common goal. This can lead to better alignment between different schools, making it easier for students to transition between institutions or regions.\n\nFurthermore, a national curriculum helps to ensure that students acquire essential knowledge and skills, regardless of their social or economic background. This can contribute to reducing educational disparity and supporting equal opportunities for all students.\n\nHowever, it is essential to maintain a balance between standardization and flexibility. While a national curriculum provides clear guidelines and expectations, it's important to also allow room for teacher and learner autonomy. This enables educators to adapt their teaching methods according to the needs of their specific classrooms, taking into consideration the diverse abilities, interests, and cultural backgrounds of their students.\n\nIn summary, a national curriculum serves to provide a core structure for the education system. It helps to ensure consistency, promote equal opportunities, and set common goals for student learning. At the same time, allowing flexibility and autonomy within the curriculum enables educators to tailor their teaching practices to best meet the individual needs of their students. This balance helps create an inclusive and effective learning environment. \n\n<user> How is the word \"curriculum\" etymologically related to the concept of a \"race\" or \"course of a race?\" \n\n<assistant> The etymological connection between \"curriculum\" and the concept of a \"race\" or \"course of a race\" comes from the word's Latin roots. The term \"curriculum\" is derived from the Latin word \"currere,\" which means \"to run\" or \"to proceed\". In classical Latin, \"curriculum\" referred to \"a running, course, career,\" and it also described fast chariots or racing cars.\n\nOver time, the word evolved and began to be used in an educational context. The first known use in this context is found in a work called \"Professio Regia\" by Petrus Ramus, a professor at the University of Paris, in 1576. The adoption of the term for describing a course of study is believed to be related to the Calvinist desire for greater order in education.\n\nThus, the connection between \"curriculum\" and the idea of a race or course of a race emerges from its origins in denoting a path, progression, or journey over time, much like one would experience in a race or specific course of study.

        "reference": "In education, a curriculum (; plural curricula  or curriculums) is broadly defined as the totality of student experiences that occur in the educational process.  The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student's experiences in terms of the educator's or school's instructional goals. A curriculum may incorporate the planned interaction of pupils with instructional content, materials, resources, and processes for evaluating the attainment of educational objectives. Curricula are split into several categories: the explicit, the implicit (including the hidden), the excluded, and the extracurricular.\n\nCurricula may be tightly standardized or may include a high level of instructor or learner autonomy.  Many countries have national curricula in primary and secondary education, such as the United Kingdom's National Curriculum.\n\nUNESCO's International Bureau of Education has the primary mission of studying curricula and their implementation worldwide.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe word \"curriculum\" began as a Latin word which means \"a race\" or \"the course of a race\" (which in turn derives from the verb currere meaning \"to run/to proceed\"). The word is \"from a Modern Latin transferred use of classical Latin curriculum \"a running, course, career\" (also \"a fast chariot, racing car\"), from currere \"to run\" (from PIE root *kers- \"to run\").\" The first known use in an educational context is in the Professio Regia, a work by University of Paris professor Petrus Ramus published posthumously in 1576. The term subsequently appears in University of Leiden records in 1582. The word's origins appear closely linked to the Calvinist desire to bring greater order to education.\n\nBy the seventeenth century, the University of Glasgow also referred to its \"course\" of study as a \"curriculum\", producing the first known use of the term in English in 1633. By the nineteenth century, European universities routinely referred to their curriculum to describe both the complete course of study (as for a degree in surgery) and particular courses and their content. By 1824, the word was defined as \"a course, especially a fixed course of study at a college, university, or school.\"\n\nDefinitions and interpretations\n\nProfessional interpretations \nThere is no generally agreed upon definition of curriculum.  Some influential definitions combine various elements to describe curriculum as follows:\nThrough the readings of Smith, Dewey, and Kelly, four types of curricula could be defined as:\nExplicit curriculum: subjects that will be taught, the identified \"mission\" of the school, and the knowledge and skills that the school expects successful students to acquire.\nImplicit curriculum: lessons that arise from the culture of the school and the behaviors, attitudes, and expectations that characterize that culture, the unintended curriculum.\nHidden curriculum: things which students learn, ‘because of the way in which the work of the school is planned and organized but which are not in themselves overtly included in the planning or even in the consciousness of those responsible for the school arrangements (Kelly, 2009).  The term itself is attributed to Philip W. Jackson and is not always meant to be a negative.  Hidden curriculum, if its potential is realized, could benefit students and learners in all educational systems.  Also, it does not just include the physical environment of the school, but the relationships formed or not formed between students and other students or even students and teachers (Jackson, 1986).",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> What is the educational approach of community high school in ann arbor, michigan, and how does it differentiate from traditional high schools? \n\n<assistant> Community high school (chs) in ann arbor, michigan, follows an experimental \"school-without-walls\" concept, which emphasizes experiential learning and active engagement with the surrounding community. This educational approach is different from traditional high schools in several ways.\n\nFirst, chs promotes an open campus, encouraging students to interact with the local community through the community resources program. This allows students to design their own courses for credit using experiential learning projects in the ann arbor area.\n\nSecond, chs is known for having a small size, which fosters a more intimate learning environment compared to larger comprehensive high schools. It also enables students to play an active role in school governance, staff hiring, and other decision-making processes.\n\nThird, the school adopts loose attendance policies, which are more similar to those of colleges than most high schools. This provides students with more flexibility and autonomy in their learning experience.\n\nAdditionally, chs eschews many traditional high school characteristics, such as interscholastic sports programs, valedictorians, dress codes, detention, hall passes, and changing bells. The school's only mascot is a rainbow-spangled zebra.\n\nOverall, community high school offers a non-traditional, student-centered, and flexible learning environment compared to many traditional high schools. \n\n<user> Could you elaborate on the early history and vision of community high school? \n\n<assistant> Community high school's early history and vision were rooted in the liberal and non-traditional ethos prevalent in ann arbor during the early 1970s. The city's school district opened two experimental alternative schools during this time: earthworks in fall 1971, and community high school (chs) in fall 1972.\n\nThe idea behind chs was to create a \"school without walls\" where students could develop their own curricula based on experiences and interactions with resource people throughout the community. Planners drew inspiration from innovative programs in other cities, such as the chicago high school for metropolitan studies, philadelphia's parkway high school, and washington, d.c.'s school without walls.\n\nAt the core of chs's early proposals were the goals to provide opportunities for a heterogeneous group of students and faculty to learn and work together, combat prejudices based on race, sex, age, lifestyle, and school achievement, and foster the development of identity and responsibility. The plan emphasized placing students of all grades in the same classes and programs and heavily relied on the community resources program and the forum program, which provided home bases for counseling and cultural studies work.\n\nChs opened in september 1972 after a $100,000 renovation of a former elementary school building at 401 north division street.

        "reference": "Community High School (CHS) is a public alternative school serving grades 9–12 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the United States. Located on a  site at 401 North Division Street near the city's Kerrytown district, CHS today enrolls approximately 450 students.\n\nEstablished in 1972, CHS was one of the first public magnet schools in the country, offering students a smaller alternative to the city's three large comprehensive high schools. It is one of the few surviving institutions among the wave of experimental high schools that were founded across the United States in the 1970s.\n\nUnlike many public alternative schools in other cities, CHS is not restricted to a particular student population (such as \"gifted\" or \"underachieving\" students), nor does it explicitly emphasize one particular area of study over others. Founded on an experimental \"school-without-walls\" concept, CHS continues to offer opportunities to interact with the surrounding community, primarily through its open campus and its Community Resources Program, an avenue for students to design their own courses for credit through experiential learning projects in the Ann Arbor area. In contrast to many traditional high schools, CHS has been known for its small size, its open campus and down to earth student participation in school governance and staff hiring, and loose attendance policies more similar to those of colleges than those at most high schools. The school has also eschewed many of the characteristics of traditional high schools, including interscholastic sports programs, valedictorians, dress codes, detention, hall passes, changing bells, mascots (aside from a rainbow-spangled zebra).\n\nEarly history\nBy the early 1970s, Ann Arbor had developed a reputation as one of the most liberal campus towns in the country. The city played host to numerous radical political organizations, eventually electing three members of the left-wing Human Rights Party to its city council. Meanwhile, the teenage group Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor was carving out a role as a national pioneer in the nascent youth rights movement, with fifteen-year-old member Sonia Yaco's insurgent school-board candidacy earning her 1,300 write-in votes, or eight percent of the total, in spring 1972. Reflecting this non-traditional ethos, the city's school district opened two experimental alternative schools during those years: Earthworks (originally Pioneer II) in fall 1971, and Community High School (CHS) in fall 1972.\n\nThe Community High idea, according to the 1972 blueprint, was to use the city as classroom – thereby creating a \"school without walls\" where students could develop their own curricula by drawing on experiences and resource people throughout the community. Although the concept was new to Ann Arbor, planners took inspiration from similar innovative programs then springing up in other cities, including the Chicago High School for Metropolitan Studies (est. 1969), Philadelphia's Parkway High School, and Washington, D.C.'s School Without Walls (est. 1971). Reflecting the liberal educational philosophy of the period, other goals in the early CHS proposals were \"to provide an opportunity for a heterogeneous group of students and faculty to learn and work together and to combat prejudices based on race, sex, age, lifestyle, and school achievement,\" and \"to foster the development of identity and responsibility.\" The plan emphasized placing students of all grades in the same classes and programs, and had at its heart the Community Resources Program and the Forum Program, small units of students integrated by age, sex and race which would provide home bases for counseling and cultural-studies work.\n\nCHS opened in September 1972, after a $100,000 renovation to an empty downtown building (constructed in 1925) that had formerly housed Jones Elementary School, a majority African-American school which was closed in 1965 due to re-districting for racial-desegregation purposes. Although members of the school board proposed naming classrooms after Ann Arborites who had been killed in the Vietnam War, these plans angered local citizens and teachers who opposed the war, and were never implemented.\n\nThe school's first dean, Dean Bodley, told the Ann Arbor News that the school's only formal rules would be two safety precautions: \"no smoking except in the student-teacher lounge and persons must wear shoes\" – although even these were quickly abandoned. The first commencement, held at the nearby St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, banished caps and gowns, valedictorians and salutorians of traditional graduation ceremonies. The community-based education concept flourished during CHS's first several years, with students developing 569 Community Resource courses in the Ann Arbor community during the fall of 1974 alone. Within the school itself, unorthodox course offerings included subjects as diverse as dream analysis and Eastern philosophy. A 1974 analysis of the school by University of Michigan researchers noted that \"[o]verall autonomy in CHS is high,\" and concluded that \"CHS is an organization dedicated to the development of humanistic principles... 'Maximum individuality within maximum community' could well be its banner.\"\n\nThrough the 1970s, enrollment remained in the high 300s. Dr. R. Wiley Brownlee, a civil-rights activist and former principal of Willow Run High School in Michigan, became CHS dean in the school's second year. In his time at Willow Run High, Brownlee had taken a conciliatory approach to mounting racial tensions at the school, an approach that eventually cost him his job.",

Shah also frequently included song lyrics and Dad jokes in an attempt to bring appropriate levity to his pandemic reports. \n\nShah's communication style and public face led to a significant following throughout Maine: A \"Fans of Dr. Nirav Shah\" Facebook page reached over 35,000 members. Stickers, T-shirts and mugs with Shah's likeness and the slogan \"In Shah We Trust\" and \"Keep Calm and Listen to Dr. Shah\" were printed and sold to benefit local nonprofits. Local confectioner Wilbur's of Maine produced \"Shah bars\" with his photo on the wrapper, and an \"In Shah We Trust\" electronic road sign was erected in Topsham, Maine.\n\nIn early 2021, Shah became president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, and he prioritized states' preparation for COVID-19 vaccine rollouts nationwide.\n\nPersonal life\nShah and his wife Kara Palamountain, a research professor at Northwestern University, are avid home cooks.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I am intrigued by the history of argos and its significance in ancient greece. role of the city during the mycenaean era and the classical period? also, i'd like to learn about how argos was affected by the various wars and conflicts that took place during this time. \n\n<assistant> Argos, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, played a substantial role during the mycenaean era and in the classical period of ancient greece. The city's strategic location on the fertile plain of argolis made it a significant stronghold during the mycenaean era. Its neighboring acropolises, mycenae and tiryns, also contributed to argos becoming an early settlement, thanks to the commanding positions they held in the midst of the argolic plain.\n\nDuring the 7th century bc, argos experienced a significant expansion and grew in power under the rule of king pheidon. Pheidon focused on regaining control over the cities of the argolid and challenging sparta's dominance in the peloponnese. Argos was a main rival of sparta, and their rivalry led to various wars and conflicts.\n\nThe battle of sepeia in 494 bc was a monumental event in argos' history. In this battle, argos suffered a devastating defeat by regional rival sparta. Following this loss, argos experienced a form of stasis, resulting in a democratic transition in the city. However, the defeat and the subsequent upheaval left argos weaker.\n\nDuring the greco-persian wars, argos remained neutral, which led to diplomatic isolation. Despite this, its prestige grew because of this neutrality, allowing argos to organize an alliance against sparta and athens in 421 bc. Unfortunately, the alliance disintegrated after the defeat at the battle of mantinea in 418 bc, further weakening argos.\n\nIn the corinthian wars, argos played a minor role against sparta. For a brief period, the city considered uniting with corinth to create an expanded argolid state, but the plan quickly fell apart. Despite remaining a minor power in greek affairs, argos escaped occupation during the reigns of philip ii and alexander the great, and it was unscathed during the wars of the diadochi. However, pyrrhus of epirus attacked argos in the battle of argos in 272 bc, during which pyrrhus was killed.\n\nOverall, argos experienced significant growth and expansion in the mycenaean era and the classical period, being involved in several wars, conflicts, and alliances. While experiencing some triumphs, it ultimately faced setbacks that weakened its power and influence in the region. \n\n<user> Fascinating! can you dive deeper into the democratic system in classical argos? how did this function during the time, and what events led to democracy being established? \n\n<assistant> Democracy in classical argos was mostly present for the period, except for a brief hiatus between 418 and 416 bc. After the crushing defeat at the battle of sepeia in 494 bc, the city experienced political instability, which resulted in the transition to democracy. The introduction of democratic rule offered a more stable and inclusive form of governance for the people of argos.\n\nThe democratic system was characterized by citizen participation in decision-making, with the general population having a say in the affairs of the city. Although we do not have specific details about the structure of the democratic system in argos, it can be assumed that it resembled other greek city-states' democratic systems. For example, in athens, the main democratic institution was the assembly (ekklesia), where free male citizens assembled to discuss and make decisions regarding city matters.\n\nDespite the establishment of democracy, argos continued to face political challenges and upheavals. However, the democratic system maintained its presence and functioned to involve citizens in the city's governance, fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility. \n\n<user> When discussing the ancient greek city of argos, i've come across the term \"argive.\" can you clarify the meaning of this term and its significance in the context of ancient greek history, particularly the trojan war? \n\n<assistant> The term \"argive\" refers to a resident of the city of argos. However, the term has a broader application in ancient greek history, particularly in the context of the trojan war. In the works of homeric bards, \"argive\" is used to denote the ancient greeks who participated in the assault on the city of troy during the trojan war.\n\nThe connection between argos and the trojan war mainly comes from the prominent role played by the city and its warriors in the conflict. Key figures in the war, such as agamemnon and diomedes, had strong ties to argos and the surrounding region, as they were leaders of the achaean forces.\n\nThus, the term \"argive\" expanded beyond its strict geographical association with argos to encompass a wider range of ancient greek warriors who were involved in the trojan war. This broadened usage signifies the importance of argos and the argolid in the cultural memory of the epic conflict. \n\n<user> How has argos managed to remain a continuously inhabited city for such an extended time? what factors have contributed to its sustained existence throughout history? \n\n<assistant> Argos' continuous habitation for over 7,000 years can be attributed to several factors that have contributed to its sustained existence throughout history. Here are some of the main factors that played a crucial role in the city's endurance:\n\n1. Strategic location: argos is situated in the fertile plain of argolis, which provides rich agricultural land and consistent water sources. This favorable environment has enabled the city to support a stable population over time.\n\n2. Geographical advantages: argos benefits from a propitious location among other notable cities, such as nemea, corinth, and arcadia. Furthermore, its proximity to lake lerna offered an additional resource at the time. These geographical features enhanced its desirability as a settlement.\n\n3. Military significance: argos has always been a stronghold in the region. Its defensible location and military prowess made it an important center for power during various periods, such as the mycenaean era and beyond. This status helped ensure the city's continued prominence and habitation.\n\n4. Economic stability: throughout history, argos has maintained a stable economy, owed mainly to agriculture, which was, and still is, the backbone of the local economy. With a fertile plain supporting agricultural activities, the economy provided the necessary resources for the population's sustenance and growth.\n\n5. Political influence: despite facing setbacks, argos managed to maintain political relevance throughout much of its history. Its involvement in various alliances, wars, and political events helped ensure its continuous habitation.\n\n6. Cultural significance: argos is deeply rooted in greek mythology and history, which can be seen in the numerous ancient monuments present within the city. Its association with legendary figures like argus and, more broadly, with the trojan war has ensured the city's cultural importance.\n\n7. Adaptation and change: argos has demonstrated an ability to adapt and change amid shifting circumstances throughout its history. For example, following its decline in political power, the city shifted its focus from the ancient agora to other parts of the city for commercial activities.\n\n8. Preservation of historical sites: the presence of many ancient monuments in argos shows a commitment to preserving its historical legacy, which has likely helped to maintain interest in the city through the ages.\n\nBy combining strategic location, geographical advantages, military significance, economic stability, political influence, cultural importance, adaptability, and historical preservation, argos has managed to maintain a continuous and thriving existence over thousands of years. These factors made the city highly attractive for settlement and persistence, ensuring the ongoing habitation of the area throughout numerous changes in history. This unique combination truly highlights the resilience and enduring nature of argos, which continues to thrive even today. ",

        "reference": "Argos (; Greek: Άργος ; Ancient Greek: Ἄργος ) is a city in Argolis, the Peloponnese, Greece and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, and the oldest in Europe. It is the largest city in Argolis and a major center for the area.\n \nSince the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the municipality of Argos-Mykines, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 138.138 km2. It is  from Nafplion, which was its historic harbour. A settlement of great antiquity, Argos has been continuously inhabited as at least a substantial village for the past 7,000 years.\n\nA resident of the city of Argos is known as an Argive ( ,  ; ). However, this term is also used to refer to those ancient Greeks generally who assaulted the city of Troy during the Trojan War; the term is more widely applied by the Homeric bards.\n\nNumerous ancient monuments can be found in the city today. Agriculture is the mainstay of the local economy.\n\nGeography\n\nClimate\nArgos has a hot Mediterranean climate. It is one of the hottest places in Greece during summer.\n\nEtymology \nThere are several proposed etyma. The name is associated with the legendary Argus, the third king of the city in ancient times, who renamed it after himself, thus replacing its older name Phoronikon Asty (Φορωνικόν Άστυ, \"Citadel of Phoroneus\"). Both the personal name and placename are linked to the word αργός (argós), which meant \"white\" or \"shining\";possibly, this had to do with the visual impression given of the Argolic plain during harvest time. According to Strabo, the name could have even originated from the word αγρός \"field\" by antimetathesis of the consonants.\n\nHistory\n\nAntiquity\n\nHerodotus first recorded the myth of the traditional story of Argos being the origin of the ancient Macedonian royal house of the Argead dynasty (Greek: Ἀργεάδαι, Argeádai) of Philip II and Alexander the Great. As a strategic location on the fertile plain of Argolis, Argos was a major stronghold during the Mycenaean era. In classical times, Argos was a powerful rival of Sparta for dominance over the Peloponnese, but was eventually shunned by other Greek city-states after remaining neutral during the Greco-Persian Wars. \n\nThere is evidence of continuous settlement in the area starting with a village about 7000 years ago in the late Neolithic, located on the foot of Aspida hill. Since that time, Argos has been continually inhabited at the same geographical location. And while the name Argos is generally accepted to have a Hellenic Indo-European etymology, Larissa is generally held to derive from a Pre-Greek substrate.\n\nThe city is located at a rather propitious area, among Nemea, Corinth and Arcadia. It also benefitted from its proximity to lake Lerna, which, at the time, was at a distance of one kilometre from the south end of Argos.\n\nArgos was a major stronghold of Mycenaean times, and along with the neighbouring acropolis of Mycenae and Tiryns became a very early settlement because of its commanding positions in the midst of the fertile plain of Argolis.\n\nArchaic Argos\n\nArgos experienced its greatest period of expansion and power under the energetic 7th century BC ruler King Pheidon. Under Pheidon, Argos regained sway over the cities of the Argolid and challenged Sparta’s dominance of the Peloponnese. Spartan dominance is thought to have been interrupted following the Battle of Hyssiae in 669–668 BC, in which Argive troops defeated the Spartans in a hoplite battle. During the time of its greatest power, the city boasted a pottery and bronze sculpturing school, pottery workshops, tanneries and clothes producers. Moreover, at least 25 celebrations took place in the city, in addition to a regular local products exhibition. A sanctuary dedicated to Hera was also found at the same spot where the monastery of Panagia Katekrymeni is located today. Pheidon also extended Argive influence throughout Greece, taking control of the Olympic Games away from the citizens of Elis and appointing himself organizer during his reign. Pheidon is also thought to have introduced reforms for standard weight and measures in Argos, a theory further reinforced with the unearthing of six \"spits\" of iron in an Argive Heraion, possibly remainders of a dedication from Pheidon.\n\nClassical Argos\n\nIn 494 BC, Argos suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of its regional rival, Sparta, at the Battle of Sepeia. Following this defeat, Herodotus tells us the city suffered a form of stasis. The political chaos is thought to have resulted in a democratic transition in the city. Argos did not participate in the Hellenic Alliance against the Persian Invasion of 480 BC. This resulted in a period of diplomatic isolation, although there is evidence of an Argive alliance with Tegea prior to 462 BC.\n\nIn 462 BC, Argos joined a tripartite alliance with Athens and Thessaly. This alliance was somewhat dysfunctional, however, and the Argives are only thought to have provided marginal contributions to the alliance at the Battle of Oenoe and Tanagra. For example, only 1,000 Argive hoplites are thought to have fought alongside the Athenians at the Battle of Tanagra. Following the allies' defeat at Tanagra in 457 BC, the alliance began to fall apart, resulting in its dissolution in 451 BC.\n\nArgos remained neutral or the ineffective ally of Athens during the Archidamian War between Sparta and Athens. Argos' neutrality resulted in a rise of its prestige among other Greek cities, and Argos used this political capital to organize and lead an alliance against Sparta and Athens in 421 BC. This alliance included Mantinea, Corinth, Elis, Thebes, Argos, and eventually Athens. This alliance fell apart, however, after the allied loss at the Battle of Mantinea in 418 BC. This defeat, combined with the raiding of the Argolid by the Epidaurians, resulted in political instability and an eventual oligarchic coup in 417 BC. Although democracy was restored within a year, Argos was left permanently weakened by this coup. This weakening led to a loss of power, which in turn led to the shift of commercial focus from the Ancient Agora to the eastern side of the city, delimited by Danaou and Agiou Konstadinou streets.\n\nArgos played a minor role in the Corinthian Wars against Sparta, and for a short period of time considered uniting with Corinth to form an expanded Argolid state. For a brief period of time, the two poleis combined, but Corinth quickly rebelled against Argive domination, and Argos returned to its traditional boundaries. After this, Argos continued to remain a minor power in Greek affairs.\n\nArgos escaped occupation by Macedon during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great and remained unscathed during the Wars of the Diadochi, however in 272 it was attacked by Pyrrhus of Epirus at the Battle of Argos, in which Pyrrhus was killed.\n\nDemocracy in Classical Argos\n\nArgos was a democracy for most of the classical period, with only a brief hiatus between 418 and 416.",

Some real-life applications of christoffel symbols include:\n\n1. General relativity: christoffel symbols are used in the mathematics behind the theory of general relativity, which describes the fundamental force of gravity. Through the calculation of the curvature of spacetime, scientists can understand gravitational phenomena around massive objects, like black holes and the formation of the universe.\n\n2. Geodesy: in the field of geodesy, which deals with the measurement and representation of earth, christoffel symbols provide valuable insights into the curvature of our planet and help in determining earth's gravitational field.\n\n3. Satellite orbits and gps systems: the equations governing satellite orbits and gps positioning systems are derived from the concept of geodesics. Geodesic equations involve the christoffel symbols, which describe how coordinates change in curved spacetime. Understanding these changes is essential for accurate satellite positioning and navigation systems.\n\n4. Cosmology: in the study of the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe, christoffel symbols are used to analyze the geometry of the cosmos and inform modern cosmological models.\n\nThese applications demonstrate the importance of christoffel symbols in various fields, acting as a bridge between mathematical concepts and real-world phenomena. Their connection with general relativity and physics allows for a deeper understanding of the universe and its underlying structure. <end_chat> \n\n<user> How does the calculation of christoffel symbols relate to the metrics of a manifold, and why is it important to work with the levi-civita connection? \n\n<assistant> Imagine you're walking on earth's bumpy surface, which can be thought of as a manifold. It has hills, valleys, and sometimes flat areas. The earth's surface's \"bumpiness\" can be described using the metric, which is a mathematical way of saying how distances are measured.\n\nNow, imagine you have a skateboard, and you want to know which way it'll naturally roll without you pushing it. This path depends on the bumpiness, or the metric, of earth's surface. The christoffel symbols give us a way to understand this natural path, called geodesic, by showing how the surface's \"bumpiness\" influences it.\n\nThe levi-civita connection is a particular connection that is special because it doesn't have any twist or torsion. You can think of torsion like a spiral staircase – if you walk in a straight line up or down, you'll end up twisting around. In many problems, especially in general relativity and physics, working with a connection without twists makes the math easier and gives more insights. And because the levi-civita connection is naturally tied to the metric, it is the perfect way to study motion and geometry of a curved surface or even spacetime! We use the christoffel symbols to represent this levi-civita connection and learn more about the manifold's shape and motion on it. <end_chat> \n\n<user> How are the christoffel symbols of the first kind different from the ones of the second kind? \n\n<assistant> Great question! The christoffel symbols come in two flavors: the first kind and the second kind. Both types allow us to study how the curvature of a manifold affects the changes in the coordinate system. However, they differ in the way they represent these changes.\n\nThe christoffel symbols of the first kind have three indices written with one upper and two lower indices, like this: {i, j, k}. Their primary purpose is to help keep track of how the basis vectors on the manifold change as you move from one point to another.\n\nOn the other hand, the christoffel symbols of the second kind have one upper and two lower indices, like this: γᵢⱼᵏ. They describe the same changes in coordinates as the first kind, but they use a different basis (the dual basis) for their representation. These symbols are more commonly used in calculations because their form makes computations, such as finding geodesics, much easier.\n\nIn summary, both the christoffel symbols of the first kind and the second kind help us understand how the geometry of a manifold impacts its coordinate system. The main difference between them is the choice of basis used, with symbols of the first kind using the original basis and symbols of the second kind using the dual basis. <end_chat> \n\n<user> How can i compute the christoffel symbols for a given metric tensor, and what role do the partial derivatives play in this process? \n\n<assistant> To compute the christoffel symbols for a given metric tensor, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the inverse metric tensor: calculate the inverse of the given metric tensor, denoted by g^(ij). You need the inverse metric to raise indices in the computations.\n \n2. Compute the partial derivatives of the metric tensor: calculate the first-order partial derivatives of each component of the given metric tensor with respect to the coordinates, denoted by ∂gₖₗ/∂xᵢ.\n\n3. Calculate the christoffel symbols of the second kind: use the following formula to compute γᵢⱼᵏ:\n\nΓᵢⱼᵏ = 1/2 * g^(ik) * (∂gₖⱼ/∂xᵢ + ∂gₖᵢ/∂xⱼ - ∂gᵢⱼ/∂xₖ)\n\nHere, the partial derivatives of the metric tensor components play a crucial role by describing the changes in the metric with respect to the coordinates. These derivatives connect the geometry of the manifold to the christoffel symbols.\n\n4. (optional) calculate the christoffel symbols of the first kind: if required, the first-kind symbols can be obtained by index lowering using the metric tensor. You can use the formula {i, j, k} = gᵢₗ * γⱼₖᵅ, where gᵢₗ is the metric tensor.\n\nRemember, the einstein summation convention applies, meaning that every time an index appears once as a superscript and once as a subscript, you should sum over that index.\n\nAfter calculating the christoffel symbols, you can use them for various purposes like finding geodesics, covariant derivatives, and understanding the curvature of the manifold through the riemann curvature tensor.

        "reference": "In mathematics and physics, the Christoffel symbols are an array of numbers describing a metric connection.  The metric connection is a specialization of the affine connection to surfaces or other manifolds endowed with a metric, allowing distances to be measured on that surface.  In differential geometry, an affine connection can be defined without reference to a metric, and many additional concepts follow: parallel transport, covariant derivatives, geodesics, etc. also do not require the concept of a metric. However, when a metric is available, these concepts can be directly tied to the \"shape\" of the manifold itself; that shape is determined by how the tangent space is attached to the cotangent space by the metric tensor. Abstractly, one would say that the manifold has an associated (orthonormal) frame bundle, with each \"frame\" being a possible choice of a coordinate frame. An invariant metric implies that the structure group of the frame bundle is the orthogonal group . As a result, such a manifold is necessarily a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold. The Christoffel symbols provide a concrete representation of the connection of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry in terms of coordinates on the manifold. Additional concepts, such as parallel transport, geodesics, etc. can then be expressed in terms of Christoffel symbols.\n\nIn general, there are an infinite number of metric connections for a given metric tensor; however, there is a unique connection that is free of torsion, the Levi-Civita connection. It is common in physics and general relativity to work almost exclusively with the Levi-Civita connection, by working in coordinate frames (called holonomic coordinates) where the torsion vanishes. For example, in Euclidean spaces, the Christoffel symbols describe how the local coordinate bases change from point to point.\n\nAt each point of the underlying -dimensional manifold, for any local coordinate system around that point, the Christoffel symbols are denoted  for . Each entry of this  array is a real number. Under linear coordinate transformations on the manifold, the Christoffel symbols transform like the components of a tensor, but under general coordinate transformations (diffeomorphisms) they do not.  Most of the algebraic properties of the Christoffel symbols follow from their relationship to the affine connection; only a few follow from the fact that the structure group is the orthogonal group  (or the Lorentz group  for general relativity).\n\nChristoffel symbols are used for performing practical calculations. For example, the Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed entirely in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their first partial derivatives. In general relativity, the connection plays the role of the gravitational force field with the corresponding gravitational potential being the metric tensor. When the coordinate system and the metric tensor share some symmetry, many of the  are zero.\n\nThe Christoffel symbols are named for Elwin Bruno Christoffel (1829–1900).\n\nNote\n\nThe definitions given below are valid for both Riemannian manifolds and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, such as those of general relativity, with careful distinction being made between upper and lower indices (contra-variant and co-variant indices). The formulas hold for either sign convention, unless otherwise noted.\n\nEinstein summation convention is used in this article, with vectors indicated by bold font. The connection coefficients of the Levi-Civita connection (or pseudo-Riemannian connection) expressed in a coordinate basis are called Christoffel symbols.\n\nPreliminary definitions\nGiven a coordinate system  for  on an -manifold , the tangent vectors\n\ndefine what is referred to as the local basis, with respect to the coordinate system , of the tangent space to  at each point of its domain. These can be used to define the metric tensor:\n\nand its inverse:\n\nwhich can in turn be used to define the dual basis:\n\nSome texts write  for , so that the metric tensor takes the particularly beguiling form . This convention also leaves use of the symbol  unambiguously for the vierbein.\n\nDefinition in Euclidean space\nIn Euclidean space, the general definition given below for the Christoffel symbols of the second kind can be proven to be equivalent to:\n\nChristoffel symbols of the first kind can then be found via index lowering:\n\nRearranging, we see that (assuming the partial derivative belongs to the tangent space, which can not occur on a non-Euclidean curved space):\n\nIn words, the arrays represented by the Christoffel symbols track how the basis changes from point to point. If the derivative doesn't lie on the tangent space, the right expression is the projection of the derivative over the tangent space (see covariant derivative below). Symbols of the second kind decompose the change with respect to the basis, while symbols of the first kind decompose it with respect to the dual basis. In this form, it's easy to see the symmetry of the lower or last two indices:\n and \nfrom the definition of  and the fact that partial derivatives commute (as long as the manifold and coordinate system are well behaved).",

In 1956, there were no hospitals in jefferson parish, and the nearby hospitals in new orleans were only accessible from the west bank by ferry across the mississippi river.\n\nA group of west bank physicians was appointed to a private committee, which then joined a committee selected by the jefferson parish policy jury. This led to the formation of the board of commissioners of the jefferson hospital service district no. 1, tasked with exploring options for developing and financing a new hospital on the westbank. After extensive research and discussion, consultants recommended criteria for a hospital to serve the growing westbank population. They determined that up to 63% of the funding would come from the hill-burton act, and 37% through locally matching funds.\n\nA public bond referendum, seeking approval for the sale of $1.5 million in bonds, was approved on september 25, 1956. These bonds were to be repaid through a 1-mill property tax assessment collected over 10 years. The u.s. Government provided an additional $1.2 million through the hill-burton act.\n\nIn february 1957, a 20-acre portion of land from the hope haven institute was purchased through the archdiocese of new orleans for $156,290, and the hospital project was publicly solicited for bids. The construction contract was signed with keller construction corporation in september 1958 for $2,170,000, leading to the completion of construction in april 1960.

Later research by Kaye et al. published in PLoS ONE (30 July 2008) challenged the claims that the material found is the soft tissue of Tyrannosaurus. A more recent study (October 2010) published in PLoS ONE contradicts the conclusion of Kaye and supports Schweitzer's original conclusion.\nEvidence for the extraction of short segments of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two occasions. The extraction of protein, soft tissue, remnant cells and organelle-like structures from dinosaur fossils has been confirmed. Blood-derived porphyrin proteins have also been discovered in a mid Eocene mosquito fossil.\n\nIn the developing field of paleoproteomics, Schweitzer has also discovered that iron particles may play a part in the preservation of soft tissue over geologic time.\n\nAwards and honors \nOn April 28, 2018 Schweitzer became the first recipient of the Dr. Elizabeth 'Betsy' Nicholls Award for Excellence in Palaeontology at the Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre's Dig Deep Gala event. As the award recipient Schweitzer was the keynote speaker and presented on her research. On March 20, 2019 the journal Nature Communications published a paper naming an extinct bird \"Avimaia schweitzerae... in honor of Mary Higby Schweitzer for her ground-breaking works on MB [ medullary bone ] and for her role in establishing the field of molecular paleontology.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Barry Yeoman, Schweitzer's Dangerous Discovery, Discover.\n North Carolina State University Faculty Page\n\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nLiving people\nAmerican evangelicals\nUtah State University alumni\nAmerican paleontologists\nWomen paleontologists\nNorth Carolina State University faculty",

It was initially known as the midtown greenway pedestrian bridge. The bridge was renamed in honor of martin olav sabo, a 14-term member of congress from minnesota, to acknowledge his contributions to the project and the city. Sabo secured $2.9 million in federal funding for the project, which ultimately cost $5.1 million, with additional funding coming from hennepin county.\n\nOpened in november 2007, the bridge plays a crucial role in the city's transportation system. It connects phase 2 and phase 3 of the minneapolis midtown greenway at hiawatha avenue, enabling continuous biking across the city. Besides, it links longfellow community (longfellow and seward neighborhoods) to phillips community (east phillips neighborhood) and connects users to the hiawatha lrt trail and little earth trail. The bridge eliminates the need for cyclists and pedestrians to cross busy hiawatha avenue at grade-level, enhancing safety and convenience. \n\n<user> Could you describe the structure and configuration of the bridge, such as its length, height, and how it helps bicyclists and pedestrians? \n\n<assistant> The martin olav sabo bridge has a total length of 2,200 feet, and its main span is 220 feet over hiawatha avenue. The cable-stay tower of the bridge rises 100 feet above the bridge-deck level. It holds the distinction of being the first true cable-stayed suspension bridge in the state of minnesota. The design, which came from engineering consulting firm urs with community input, offers an efficient and safe route for pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\nThe configuration of the bridge has been designed to improve safety and convenience for its users. Previously, bicyclists and pedestrians had to cross hiawatha avenue using a grade-level stoplight, which posed risks due to heavy traffic. The sabo bridge eliminates this issue by bringing users north one block, taking them over the highway, and then bringing them back south, introducing a new grade-level crossing at 28th street east, just west of hiawatha. This design significantly reduces the number of interactions between users and traffic, ensuring a safer crossing experience.\n\nDespite the existence of the bridge, users can still choose to use the at-grade hiawatha crossing if they wish. The bridge not only enhances connectivity between neighborhoods and trails but also promotes a safer and more enjoyable biking and walking experience for minneapolis residents and visitors. \n\n<user> In 2012, there were structural failures that caused the bridge to be closed several times. what were the causes of the issues, and what steps were taken to address them? \n\n<assistant> The martin olav sabo bridge experienced structural failures in 2012 that led to several closures. On february 19, 2012, two of the bridge's longest support cables were found to be detached and lying across the bridge deck below. As a result, the bridge was closed to all traffic, including the portions of hiawatha avenue that pass underneath, and the light rail service was suspended on tracks beneath the bridge.\n\nThe initial cable failure resulted from cracks in diaphragm plates that anchor the ends of the cables to the steel tower. Upon further inspection, significant cracks were found in three of those anchorages. Engineering firm wiss, janney, elstner associates, inc. Was hired to investigate the cause of the plate compromise. A summary report of the failure analysis released on june 8, 2012, identified that unaccounted wind-induced cable vibrations led to the failures of the attachment points.\n\nEmergency supports were placed underneath the bridge, and a second pair of cables were removed due to cracks in their anchor points. The light rail service resumed on february 24, 2012, and hiawatha avenue was reopened to traffic beneath the bridge on february 27, 2012. The bridge, supported by temporary bracing, was reopened on june 1, 2012. However, it was closed again for repairs on september 23, 2012, before finally reopening on november 19, 2012, after the completion of necessary repairs.\n\nThese incidents highlighted the need for enhanced structural analysis and monitoring to ensure the safety of such infrastructure projects, ultimately leading to improvements in bridge design, construction, and maintenance practices.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> In television production, what is the significance of safe areas and how do they ensure that the most important parts of the picture are seen by the majority of viewers? \n\n<assistant> Safe areas are crucial in television production to guarantee that vital parts of the visual content are viewable by most audiences, regardless of their television screen. There are two primary types of safe areas: title-safe and action-safe areas.\n\nTitle-safe area is a rectangular region far enough from the edges of the screen where text or graphics can be displayed neatly, without distortion. This area ensures that elements like lower thirds or full-screen graphics maintain their readability and visibility without being cut off, even if displayed on older televisions or devices with different screen sizes.\n\nAction-safe area is an extended rectangle that surrounds the title-safe area. This area creates a margin or buffer space around the screen so that visual elements don't crowd the screen's edge, maintaining a clean and clutter-free look. Tv stations and networks typically place crucial information within the action-safe area.\n\nOlder televisions may have a smaller viewable area compared to modern flat-panel, plasma, or lcd screens. By using safe areas during production, content creators can make sure that their target audience can view the most important parts of the picture, even on a variety of different television screens. This approach minimizes the risk of distortion or content loss caused by variations in television hardware and settings. In addition, different broadcast standards like ntsc and pal also affect how the content is displayed. So, safe areas provide a consistent way to ensure that the relevant information is visible on most screens. \n\n<user> Can you clarify the differences between the action-safe area, title-safe area, and overscan? also, how are digital compression technologies like mpeg-4 related to these areas? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Let's first recap their definitions:\n\n1. Title-safe area: this is the innermost rectangle where text and graphics can be displayed without distortion or being cut off on most television screens. Content placed in this area remains legible and undistorted, ensuring that essential information is accessible to viewers.\n\n2. Action-safe area: this is a larger rectangle that includes the title-safe area, extending outward from it. The purpose of the action-safe area is to provide a buffer or margin around the screen, so elements don't appear too close to the edge, maintaining a neat presentation. Important visual content is typically placed within this region to cater to a wider range of television screen sizes and display settings.\n\n3. Overscan: this is the area outside the action-safe area, often not displayed on consumer television screens unless the user modifies their tv settings. The overscan area is where elements not meant to be seen by viewers can be placed, like the edge of a set or cables.\n\nAs for digital compression technologies like mpeg-4, these video codecs compress only the active picture area, which includes both action-safe and title-safe areas (plus the overscan). In other words, mpeg-4 and similar codecs focus on compressing the actual visible content and not the blanking intervals or other parts of the broadcast signal. By doing so, they optimize compression efficiency and work effectively with the digital distribution of video content.\n\nMpeg-2, an older codec, is closely tied to analog broadcasting and has limited size options. Thus, it might capture some nominal analog blanking regions in addition to the active picture. Modern codecs like mpeg-4 accommodate only the genuine active picture and are designed specifically to work with digital distribution methods. \n\n<user> How does aspect ratio relate to the use of safe areas and overscan? \n\n<assistant> Aspect ratio plays a significant role in determining how safe areas and overscan function in television production.\n\nAspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of the video frame. There are multiple aspect ratios, but the most common ones are 4:3 for standard-definition content and 16:9 for high-definition and widescreen content.\n\nWhen producing content in a 4:3 aspect ratio, the entire active picture, which includes the action-safe area and overscan, is transmitted to fill the screen horizontally, with no black areas around the edges. Since various television screens might display the content differently, using the safe areas ensures that essential parts of the picture, both visually and textually, are visible to most viewers, regardless of their television screen or aspect ratio.\n\nFor widescreen programming, 14:9 or 16:9 aspect ratios are commonly used. These formats often have zero overscan at the top and bottom of the picture, where letterbox bars appear on a 4:3 television screen. This approach prevents unintentional content loss or distortion when the picture is displayed on different screen sizes or aspect ratios.\n\nUsing safe areas in alignment with different aspect ratios ensures that crucial visual and textual content remains visible and undistorted on various television screens with specific aspect ratio conventions, accommodating both old and new screens, as well as various broadcast standards. \n\n<user> In video editing software, how can one make sure that titles and text stay within the title-safe area and what examples can you provide of software that offers ways to manage safe areas? \n\n<assistant> Video editing software often provides tools and features to help users manage safe areas and ensure titles and text stay within the title-safe area.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n1. Safe area overlays or guidelines: many video editing applications have a built-in feature that shows safe area overlays or guidelines. These overlays usually consist of two rectangular outlines: one for the title-safe area and another for the action-safe area. Users can enable these guidelines on the editing software's preview or canvas screen to ensure their text and graphics are positioned within the title-safe area.\n\n2. Safe margins for export: several video editing programs provide export settings specifically designed for television or web delivery. These settings let users adjust safe margins or choose relevant presets. For example, in apple's imovie, users are advised to uncheck the \"qt margins\" checkbox when exporting content for television, ensuring that the titles stay within the title-safe area.\n\n3. Resizing and scaling tools: some editing packages come with resizing and scaling features that allow users to manipulate elements like text or graphics and easily fit them within the title-safe area. These functions help users maintain the visual quality and legibility of the elements, making sure they fit within the safe boundaries.\n\nA few examples of video editing software packages that offer tools to manage safe areas:\n- final cut pro: apple's professional-grade video editing software provides overlay rectangles to show the title-safe and action-safe areas in both the viewer and canvas.\n- adobe premiere pro: in premiere pro, users can enable an option called \"safe margins\" in the program monitor to display title-safe and action-safe overlays.\n- avid media composer: this software also offers safe area overlays that can be enabled as part of the interface settings.\n\nUsing these tools in video editing software ensures that the content creators position titles, text, and other essential graphic elements within the designated safe areas, preventing distortion or loss of information when displayed on various television screens.

        "reference": "Safe area is a term used in television production to describe the areas of the television picture that can be seen on television screens.\n\nOlder televisions can display less of the space outside of the safe area than ones made more recently. Flat panel screens, plasma displays and liquid crystal display (LCD) screens generally can show most of the picture outside the safe areas.\n\nThe use of safe areas in television production ensures that the most important parts of the picture are seen by the majority of viewers.\n\nThe size of the title-safe area is typically specified in pixels or percent. The NTSC and PAL analog television standards do not specify official overscan amounts, and producers of television programming use their own guidelines.\n\nSome video editing software packages for non-linear editing systems (NLE) solutions have a setting which shows the safe areas while editing.\n\nTitle-safe area \n\nThe title-safe area or graphics-safe area is, in television broadcasting, a rectangular area which is far enough in from the four edges, such that text or graphics show neatly: with a margin and without distortion.  This is applied against a worst case of on-screen location and display type.  Typically corners would require more space from the edges, but due to increased quality of the average display this is no longer the concern it used to be, even on CRTs.\n\nIf the editor of the content does not take care to ensure that all titles are inside the title-safe area, some titles in the content could have their edges chopped off when viewed in some screens.\n\nVideo editing programs that can output video for either television or the Web can take the title-safe area into account. In Apple's consumer-grade NLE software iMovie, the user is advised to uncheck the QT Margins checkbox for content meant for television, and to check it for content meant only for QuickTime on a computer. Final Cut Pro can show two overlay rectangles in both its Viewer and Canvas; the inner rectangle is the title-safe area and the outer rectangle is the action-safe area.\n\nIn the illustration, the green area is referred to as the \"title-safe\" area (note that these colors are for illustration only and do not appear on the television screens). This area will be seen by all television screens, no matter when they were made, unless the user has modified the settings. The term \"title-safe\" originated from the fact this is where it is safe to display text such as lower thirds or full-screen graphics listing information such as telephone numbers.\n\nAction-safe area \nDepending on how a television set is adjusted, viewers can see a larger area than the title-safe area.  The action-safe area is a larger rectangle, consisting of the green title-safe area and a rectangle around it shown in yellow.  , most television stations and networks will place information within this area. This area can be considered the \"margin\" of the television screen in that picture elements are generally kept out of this area to create a buffer around the edge of the screen so elements don't pile up against the edge of the screen. If the station uses a permanent digital on-screen graphic, it is placed just near the corner of the yellow area.\n\nHowever, the yellow area might be used if the television station wants the information to block against the edge of the screen. Many stations (e.g. BBC News) place tickers that run horizontally in some of the yellow area.\n\nAction-safe area is applied against a worst case of on-screen location and display type.\n\nOverscan \n\nThe red border in the illustration represents the overscan, the area of the active picture outside the action-safe area. It is not shown on most consumer television screens, unless the user modifies the television's settings. It is generally considered safe to have elements that shouldn't be seen by the viewers placed in this area, such as the edge of the set or cables and other equipment. However, some television production personnel don't place anything in this area they don't want viewers to see because the red area is always transmitted and could potentially be seen by a viewer with the correct equipment. Television stations generally have professional-grade monitors that can be put into \"underscan\" mode. These monitors often include white lines showing where the title-safe and safe areas are located. In addition, TV tuner cards and DVD players for personal computers often show the entire picture.\n\nThe action-safe area (green + yellow) and overscan area (red) make up the entire transmitted image, or active picture.\n\nIn addition to active picture, analog broadcast signals contain blanking areas that provide timings and control.  When applying digital compression such as MPEG-4, it is only sensible to compress picture that actually exists, and active picture is what is used — including areas not available in action-safe areas.  (MPEG-2 is a bad example, since it has many ties to analogue broadcasting, and employs only a few set sizes;  this is why it will always capture nominal analogue blanking in addition to the active picture next to it.)\n\nSince there are such a wide variety of television screens that may display pictures slightly differently, programs produced in 4:3 aspect ratio are transmitted with picture information in the yellow and red areas to ensure the picture takes up the entire screen with no black area around the edges.\nWidescreen programs in 14:9 or 16:9 aspect ratio, on the other hand, are produced with zero overscan at the top and bottom of the picture, where the letterbox bars appear on a 4:3 television.\n\nReferences\n\nTelevision terminology\nTelevision technology",

The mclaughlin group, denoted as mcl, is a sporadic simple group in the area of modern algebra known as group theory. It has an order of 898,128,000, which is approximately 9. The mclaughlin group is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was discovered as an index 2 subgroup of a rank 3 permutation group that acts on the mclaughlin graph. It fixes a 2-2-3 triangle in the leech lattice, making it a subgroup of the conway groups co1, co2, and co3.\n\nThe schur multiplier of mcl has order 3, and its outer automorphism group has order 2. Interesting to note, the group 3.mcl:2 is a maximal subgroup of the lyons group. Mcl has one conjugacy class of involution and a maximal subgroup of type 2.a8. \n\nIn terms of representations, mcl has normalizer mcl:2 in the conway group co3 and has two classes of maximal subgroups isomorphic to the mathieu group m22. It is the only sporadic group to admit irreducible representations of quaternionic type, having two such representations with dimensions of 3520 and 4752. \n\n<user> Thank you for the explanation! maximal subgroups of the mclaughlin group? what are the conjugacy classes and their properties? \n\n<assistant> Sure! There are 12 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of the mclaughlin group. These classes were determined by mathematician michael j. Collins. The maximal subgroups and their properties are as follows:\n\n1. U4(3): it has an order of 3,265,920 and an index of 275. This subgroup is the point stabilizer of mcl's action on the mclaughlin graph.\n2. M22: it has an order of 443,520 and an index of 2,025. There are two classes of this subgroup, which are fused under an outer automorphism. Mcl has 2 classes of maximal subgroups isomorphic to the mathieu group m22. The outer automorphism interchanges the two classes of m22 groups.\n3. U3(5): it has an order of 126,000 and an index of 7,128.\n\nThese are the most significant maximal subgroups of the mclaughlin group. In group theory, conjugacy classes are important because they help classify group elements with similar properties. In the case of mcl, the centralizer of its one conjugacy class of involution (element of order 2) is a maximal subgroup of type 2.a8. The quotient modulo of the center of this subgroup is isomorphic to the alternating group a8.\n\nConjugacy classes, along with the maximal subgroups, provide insights into the internal structure and symmetries of the mclaughlin group. This information is essential for understanding various representations and automorphisms within the group. \n\n<user> I appreciate the detailed information. lastly, can you tell me more about the mclaughlin group's association with the leech lattice and the significance of the 2-2-3 triangle? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! The leech lattice is a 24-dimensional even unimodular lattice, which has significant applications in various areas of mathematics, such as number theory, coding theory, and the study of finite groups. In the context of the mclaughlin group, its connection to the leech lattice lies in the group's ability to fix a particular 2-2-3 triangle existing within the lattice. By fixing this 2-2-3 triangle, the mclaughlin group becomes a subgroup of the conway groups co1, co2, and co3. \n\nThe importance of the 2-2-3 triangle in this context stems from the fact that it helps define the mclaughlin group's position within the larger structure of the leech lattice and the related conway groups. The mclaughlin group's ability to fix this triangle reveals information about the group's unique symmetries and combinatorial properties that distinguish it from other sporadic groups.\n\nMoreover, this 2-2-3 triangle influences the mcl group's representations, as evidenced by its presence within the conway group co3. In co3, mcl has the normalizer mcl:2, which is maximal in the co3 group. The outer automorphisms realized on mcl deals with the two classes of m22 groups, which is embedded as a subgroup of co3.\n\nIn summary, the mclaughlin group's connection with the leech lattice and the 2-2-3 triangle plays a crucial role in understanding its position, structure, and various mathematical properties.

Late autumn (1960) - in this film, saburi took on the role of soichi mamiya, a widower who considers remarrying but experiences conflict within his family.\n\nThese films are considered classics in japanese cinema and demonstrate the depth and range of shin saburi's acting abilities. \n\n<user> What was his final film role before his death? \n\n<assistant> Shin Saburi's final film role was in the 1982 movie \"Kaseki no kouya\" (The Fossil Wilderness). In this film, he portrayed the character Haruyoshi Nakaomi. The movie revolves around a retired businessman who leaves his life in the city to live a quiet existence in the countryside. Here, he meets various people, learns about their lives, and has his own revelations about life.\n\nShin Saburi passed away the same year \"Kaseki no kouya\" was released. Throughout his prolific career, he contributed significantly to the Japanese film industry not only as an actor but also as a director. He was best known for his collaboration with famed director Yasujirō Ozu, and their films together continue to be celebrated for their exploration of familial relationships, societal pressures, and the human experience. Saburi's performances, in particular, were lauded for their depth and authenticity, leaving a lasting impact on Japanese cinema. \n\n<user> Can you give me an overview of his career on television? were there any notable shows he starred in or contributed to? \n\n<assistant> Shin saburi also had a notable career on television. He appeared in a few tv series, with some of the most noteworthy ones being:\n\n1. \"akatsuki\" (1963-1964) - this was a morning drama series (asadora) aired on nhk.

Furring strips (sometimes called battens in the u.k.) are thin strips of wood or other materials used in construction to level or raise a surface, prevent dampness, create space for insulation, or to resurface ceilings or walls. The process of installing these strips is called \"furring\", and it is also used to describe the strips themselves.\n\nWood furring strips typically measure 1 x 2 or 1 x 3 inches and can be laid out perpendicular to studs or joists, then nailed to them.

Wider spacing is used behind heavy boards that support ceramic tiles, whereas closely spaced strips are needed for thin paneling or plaster.\n\nIn the context of insulation, furring strips can provide space between the wall sheathing and the interior finish material. This gap allows for insulation, such as rigid foam or mineral wool, to be installed.

However, furring is still often used in remodeling projects to fill out uneven sections or to provide space for additional insulation. \n\n<user> What materials can i use for furring strips, and how do i choose the right one for my specific needs? \n\n<assistant> Furring strips can be made from various materials, including wood, metal, and even plastic. The choice of material depends on your specific needs, budget, and local building codes.\n\nWood furring strips are the most common and cost-effective option. They're typically made of softwoods like pine, fir, or spruce, and come in widths of 1 x 2 or 1 x 3 inches. Use wood furring strips if you want an affordable and versatile solution that works for most situations.\n\nMetal furring strips, often called \"hat channels,\" are used when fire-resistant materials or extra rigidity is required by the local building code. These are a good choice for commercial projects or areas where fire hazards are a concern. Metal furring strips are typically more expensive than wood but provide superior durability and fire-resistance.\n\nPlastic furring strips are a less common option, but they can be used in moisture-prone areas or when a lightweight, rot-resistant material is desired. Keep in mind that plastic may not provide the same strength or structural support as wood or metal.\n\nTo choose the right material, consider factors like budget, local building codes, the type of insulation and wall materials being used, and whether moisture or fire resistance is necessary. If unsure about the best option, consult a contractor or building professional to discuss your specific needs and requirements. \n\n<user> Can you explain how furring strips are used in ship repair, especially in the context of late 16th century and early 17th century england? \n\n<assistant> Furring, as a ship repair method, was indicative of late 16th century and early 17th century england. During this period, ships were primarily constructed with wooden materials, requiring regular maintenance and repair to keep them seaworthy. The process of furring involved attaching thin strips of wood or other materials to the hull of the ship.\n\nIn the context of ship repair, furring strips served several purposes. They could help strengthen and reinforce the ship's structural frame, fill and support weakened or damaged areas, or improve water drainage by creating channels for water to flow away from the hull. This latter function is particularly important, as better water drainage can help prevent rot and decay, prolonging the life of the ship.\n\nUnfortunately, specific details about the ship furring process and techniques during this historical period are scarce. However, it's clear that furring was a widespread and essential maintenance practice, contributing to the durability and longevity of wooden ships during this era.\n\nFurring in ship repair evolved over time but gradually became less relevant with the advent of new shipbuilding materials and techniques, such as metal and fiberglass hulls, which provide improved durability and resistance to water damage.

Furring refers to the process of installing the strips and to the strips themselves. Firring is a U.K. term for wood strips which are usually 50 mm wide, tapered and fixed above wood roof joists to provide drainage falls below roof boarding. Furring strips themselves are typically referred to as battens in the U.K. and sometimes the material is called strapping in the U.S.\n\nIn buildings\nWood furring strips typically measure 1 x 2 or 1 x 3 inches.

The spacing between the strips depends on the type of finishing material.  Wider spacing is typically used behind the heavy boards that support ceramic tiles.  Closely spaced strips are needed for thin panelling or plaster.  The use of strips with plaster, however, is called either lath and plaster or wattle and daub. The origin of the furring strip may be from the root \"furr\", which is the term given to the space behind the field of lath.\n\nMetal furring strips are used for commercial projects, or in towns where fire-proof supporting elements are required by the local building code. Often called \"hat channels\" to describe the profile (cross section), they consist of two flanges on each side of a trapezoid shape, 7/8 in thick.\n\nFurring is also used to support roof materials and may be seen under barn and shed roofs but is now used less often, replaced by labor-saving plywood.  Drywall has become the most common interior wall finishing material and does not need furring due to its strength.

Since buzz is officially part of georgia tech's cheerleading team, the tryouts occur simultaneously with the other cheerleading tryouts.\n\nThere are several requirements for those interested in assuming the role of buzz. Firstly, candidates must maintain secrecy about their identity until they graduate. Physical condition is essential; they should have the ability to perform a front \"suicide\" flip, known as the buzz flip, which is buzz's trademark move. Height is also a consideration, as the ideal height for buzz is around 5 ft 4 in tall (1.63 meters).\n\nIt's important to note that multiple individuals may have the opportunity to become buzz, wearing the mascot costume at different events. As such, these individuals need to keep their identities a secret not only from the public but also from each other. This tradition adds to the mystique surrounding the mascot and the school spirit.\n\nBuzz is beloved for his energy, spirit, and pranks, so candidates should possess a playful and enthusiastic attitude to adequately portray the character. In addition to cheering at sports events, buzz also appears at official georgia tech occasions, charity events, and social gatherings such as weddings and birthday parties. Therefore, strong interpersonal skills and the capacity to engage with people of all ages would be beneficial attributes for a successful buzz candidate. \n\n<user> Origin and history of the term yellow jacket at georgia tech? \n\n<assistant> The term \"yellow jacket\" or \"yellowjacket\" has a deep-rooted history at georgia tech, dating back to the 1890s when it was initially used to refer to students and sports teams. Fans supporting early georgia tech teams would wear yellow jackets to the games as a display of loyalty and encouragement.\n\nInitially, the early football teams didn't have gold fabric for jerseys, so they wore yellow jerseys instead. This practice likely contributed to the adoption of the name \"yellow jackets.\" in october 1905, john heisman, a notable football coach, told the atlanta constitution that he wanted his teams to be called the yellow jackets. In november 1906, the atlanta journal published a cartoon featuring a university of georgia football player being attacked by a yellowjacket with the caption \"somebody's about to get stung.\" this publication marked the first time georgia tech sports teams were referred to in print as the georgia tech yellow jackets.\n\nThe creation of the buzz mascot is attributed to judi mcnair. In 1972, she designed a homemade yellowjacket costume and performed at home football games, even riding on the ramblin' wreck. Her idea was well-received, leading to the adoption of the buzz mascot and its later reinvention by richie bland in 1979. ",

It was organized at indianapolis, indiana, and mustered in on december 20, 1861, for three years of service.\n\nThroughout its service, the battery was attached to various divisions and corps within the union army. They were stationed in locations such as cairo, illinois; army of the tennessee; district of jackson, tennessee; department of the tennessee; and xvi corps. The non-veterans of the battery mustered out on march 6, 1865, while the remaining men mustered out on june 25, 1865.\n\nThe 9th indiana battery participated in several campaigns and battles, including the battle of shiloh, the siege of corinth, grant's central mississippi campaign, the red river campaign, and the battle of nashville, among others. Throughout their service, the battery suffered casualties, including 6 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, and 55 enlisted men who died of disease. Lieutenant george r. Was one of the commanders of the battery. \n\n<user> Can you please provide more details about their involvement in the battle of shiloh and the red river campaign? \n\n<assistant> Certainly. At the battle of shiloh, which took place on april 6-7, 1862, the 9th indiana battery light artillery was part of the union army gathered near pittsburg landing, tennessee. It was a fierce and bloody battle against confederate forces, and the union army ultimately emerged victorious. This battle was a significant early clash in the western theater of the civil war and helped to set the stage for future union offensives in the region.\n\nDuring the red river campaign, which took place from march 10 to may 22, 1864, the 9th indiana battery participated in several engagements. The goal of this campaign was for the union army to assert control over the red river in louisiana, essentially uprooting the confederate presence in the area. The battery took part in the capture of fort derussy on march 14 and the occupation of alexandria, louisiana, on march 16. They were also involved in the battle of pleasant hill on april 9 and the engagements at and around cloutiersville from april 22-24. The battery supported union forces during their retreat to morganza, louisiana, between may 13 and may 20, participating in fights at avoyelle's prairie and yellow bayou. Although the red river campaign was considered a failure overall for the union, the 9th indiana battery light artillery played a valuable role in several key engagements. \n\n<user> What happened to the battery after the battle of nashville? \n\n<assistant> After the battle of nashville, which took place on december 15-16, 1864, the 9th indiana battery light artillery participated in the pursuit of confederate general john bell hood's army to the tennessee river from december 17-28. This pursuit followed the union's victory at nashville, where they successfully defeated hood's forces.\n\nFollowing these events, the 9th indiana battery was ordered to indiana on january 25, 1865. Tragically, they faced disaster when the steamer eclypse, transporting the battery, blew up at johnsonville on january 27, 1865. Of the 70 officers and men on board, only 10 escaped unhurt. The veterans and recruits who survived were then assigned to duty at camp butler in springfield, illinois, where they remained until their discharge in june 1865.\n\nThroughout their service, the battery experienced significant casualties. A total of 61 men were lost - 6 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded in battle, and 55 enlisted men who succumbed to disease. The experiences and sacrifices of the 9th indiana battery light artillery remain an important part of the complex history of the american civil war. \n\n<user> What was the impact of this battery on the overall war? \n\n<assistant> The 9th indiana battery light artillery, like many other units in the civil war, played a crucial role in various campaigns and battles. While it is challenging to quantify their exact impact on the overall war, their contribution to multiple engagements, including the battle of shiloh, the red river campaign, and the battle of nashville, among others, demonstrates their significance in the union war effort.\n\nTheir service in these battles aided in the union's push to achieve strategic objectives, weaken confederate forces, and assert control over key regions. As part of artillery units, the 9th indiana battery provided essential fire support to infantry and cavalry operations, which was vital in achieving battlefield success. Their sacrifices and service are an integral piece of the larger tapestry of the american civil war, representing the fortitude and resilience of the union forces. ",

The story goes, \"In the black, black world there was a black, black town and in the black, black town there was a black, black house and in the black, black house there was a black, black cupboard and in the black, black cupboard there was a white box.\" This story served as the basis for the verse in \"Walking on Air.\"\n\nThe song, in general, is about following your dreams and going with the flow. It tells the story of a \"little creepy girl that comes from a little creepy place\" who has a big dream and loves music, but nobody believes in her. The specific details in the song, such as \"cats and hats and rocking chairs,\" are based on Kerli's own childhood experiences. As a child, she often wore older hats.\n\nThese elements combine to create a unique and memorable story that captivates listeners, providing them with a sense of introspection and encouragement to follow their dreams despite any obstacles or doubt. \n\n<user> That's so intriguing. now, i'd like to know more about the music video for \"walking on air.\" can you describe the production process, the directorial team behind it, and give a synopsis of the video's storyline? \n\n<assistant> Kerli created a \"book of kerli\" with pictures depicting her vision for the music video. The directorial team, known as \"aggressive,\" comprises alex topaller and dan shapiro. The video premiered on may 19, 2008.\n\nThe storyline features an inverted house theme where everything is opposite of what it usually is. It begins with a man delivering a box containing a ball-jointed doll, followed by various surreal scenes, including a fireplace growing lotuses, kerli dancing as the room spins, and a kitchen with a wintry forest backdrop. Other scenes depict her \"roasting\" a chicken in a cold oven and crying tears that transform into butterflies. \n\n<user> That sounds fascinating! could you provide further details on the most captivating and surreal scenes in the music video and the symbolism behind these scenes? \n\n<assistant> The \"walking on air\" music video is filled with fantastical and surreal elements, creating a dream-like atmosphere. Some of the most captivating scenes include:\n\n1. Fireplace with lotuses: kerli lights a match and throws it into the fireplace, causing it to grow lotuses. Lotuses symbolize purity, spiritual awakening, and rebirth, which might allude to the growth and transformation that occurs when one follows their dreams.\n\n2. Spinning room: as kerli activates a ceiling fan, the room starts spinning around, and she dances. This scene can be interpreted as her embracing chaos and the unpredictable nature of life while remaining true to her dreams and aspirations.\n\n3. Kitchen with forest backdrop: the walls of the kitchen display an open wintry forest, with snow spewing from an umbrella and windows replaced by brick walls. The contrast between the cold outdoors and the traditionally warm kitchen evokes a sense of displacement or being lost, reflecting the challenges faced when chasing dreams.\n\n4. Cold oven and flaming fridge: kerli \"roasts\" a chicken in a freezing oven and places it in a fridge engulfed in flames. This inversion represents the reversal of expectations and the unconventional path she takes to achieve her goals.\n\n5. Floating tears transforming into butterflies: while lying on a bed of stones, kerli cries, and her tears float up, turning into butterflies. This beautiful symbolism highlights the transformative power of emotions and their ability to create change and growth.\n\nThese visually striking scenes come together to form a vivid representation of following one's dreams and embracing life's paradoxes, reflecting the song's core message and creative vision thoroughly.

After he leaves, Kerli opens the box and finds a ball-jointed doll (painted by artist Lisa Jameson aka Pepstar). After re-entering the house, Kerli turns on the TV which shows a close-up image of an eye staring around the room. She then lights a match and throws it in the fireplace when it then begins to grow lotuses. Next, she activates the ceiling fan which precedes to spin the room around as she begins to dance.\n\nIn the next scene, Kerli is in a kitchen where the walls are an open wintry forest and Kerli appears in a more sexualized black outfit. The windows are brick walls and snow is spewing out of an umbrella. She opens the oven which is an extremely cold freezer where a chicken is \"roasting\". She then takes the chicken and places it in the fridge which is full of flames.\n\nNext, Kerli is now in her bedroom lying on a bed of stones when she starts to cry (although the tears come from the Moonstones under her eyes) and her tears float up and transform into butterflies. Another scene is shown where Kerli is with a bird in a cage and the bird is sitting upside down on a perch.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Ann eliza bleecker's childhood and upbringing. \n\n<assistant> Ann eliza bleecker was born as ann eliza schuyler in october 1752 in new york city, in the province of new york. She was the sixth child of margareta van wyck and brandt schuyler, who were successful merchants and members of the american dutch aristocracy. Tragically, her father died after a long illness just before she was born.\n\nAnn demonstrated a precocious writing ability from an early age. She was often asked to recite her poems, which encompassed a range of styles, from sentimental or humorous to sophisticated or satirical. It was not uncommon for her to compose impromptu poems at the request of friends.\n\nIn 1760, ann's mother remarried to anthony teneyck, who was also part of the dutch elite. Ann's childhood appeared to be marked by security, abundance, and happiness. She gained a new sister, susanna teneyck, with whom she grew up.\n\nOn march 29, 1769, ann schuyler married a lawyer from new rochelle named john james bleecker. They moved to poughkeepsie shortly after their marriage. In 1771, john decided to abandon law and took up agriculture as a profession. The couple then moved to his pastoral country estate in tomhannock, eighteen miles north of albany, which was settled by dutch families.\n\nTheir home was a reflection of their wealth, adorned with beautiful furnishings and surrounded by picturesque gardens and orchards. Bleecker considered her home a \"retreat,\" and during her first five years in tomhannock, she wrote most of her pastoral poetry. She also corresponded with friends and relatives, describing both her sense of isolation and the beauty of her surroundings.\n\nJohn james bleecker was a supportive husband who encouraged her writing, referring to it as \"her genius.\" in the winter of 1779, ann published a periodical called the \"albany gazette\" that consisted entirely of her political essays, poems, and short stories. The publication was primarily meant to share news and entertainment with friends and relatives.\n\nAnn eliza bleecker's upbringing helped shape her love for poetry and writing. With the support of her husband and a comfortable home, she made a name for herself through her writing in both poetry and prose. Bleecker's work remains relevant today, as historians study it to gain perspective on life during the american revolution. \n\n<user> How did the american revolution impact ann bleecker and her family? \n\n<assistant> The american revolution significantly disrupted ann bleecker and her family's pastoral life. In 1777, british troops led by general john burgoyne invaded tomhannock as part of burgoyne's saratoga campaign to capture the hudson river. In response to this, ann's husband john joined the new york militia, while she was forced to flee southward with their two daughters.\n\nAnn faced numerous hardships during her flight. She traveled on foot with her daughters, the infant abella and six-year-old margaretta, toward albany. Unfortunately, abella died of dysentery along the way. Further tragedy struck when ann's mother, who had joined them, died en route to red hook. After burgoyne's surrender on october 17, 1777, ann and the remaining family members returned to tomhannock, but her sister, caty swits, died during the journey as well.\n\nThe war brought more distress for ann when in 1781, she received news that her husband had been captured by loyalist forces or possibly wandering british soldiers. This caused her to suffer a miscarriage and a nervous breakdown. Devastated by the loss of multiple family members and unable to fully recover from these traumatic events, ann's writing began to reflect a sense of melancholy and depression. \n\n<user> What is the significance of her novel maria kittle? \n\n<assistant> Maria kittle, written by ann eliza bleecker, holds a special place in literary history as the first known captivity novel. This work set the form for a popular genre of american fiction known as indian capture novels, which saw increased popularity after bleecker's death.\n\nCaptivity narratives were accounts of people's experiences being captured by native americans, often during times of conflict between european settlers and indigenous peoples. These stories typically focused on the sufferings and trials faced by captives, as well as their eventual escape or release. Indian capture novels, which are a fictionalized variation of these stories, sought to engage readers by focusing on the captives' struggles and adventures.\n\nAnn eliza bleecker's maria kittle played a significant role in establishing the format and style for the genre. Many subsequent novels drew inspiration from her work and continued to explore themes related to abduction, survival, and the clash of cultures.\n\nToday, bleecker's novel is studied by historians and literary scholars alike. Through examining her work, they can gain a unique glimpse into life on the front lines of the american revolution and the relationships between european settlers and native americans. The genre also offers a context for understanding the attitudes and cultural influences of the time. \n\n<user> How do historians use bleecker's pastoral poetry to understand the american revolution? \n\n<assistant> Ann Eliza Bleecker's pastoral poetry provides historians with a valuable perspective on the lives of individuals affected by the American Revolution, particularly those residing in rural areas. Her poems are descriptive, evocative, and express the emotional impact of the war on her and her family. While her poetry does not focus solely on the politics or military aspects of the conflict, it offers insights into the personal experiences of those who lived through it.\n\nBy studying her poetry, historians can glean a sense of the beauty and tranquility of pre-war life in the countryside, as well as the disruption and devastation brought on by the war. Her poetry captures the emotions and experiences of someone caught up in the turmoil of the time, revealing her deep attachment to her surroundings and the challenges she faced in trying to maintain a sense of normalcy amid the chaos.\n\nBleecker's pastoral poems offer a window into the more intimate, human aspects of the American Revolution. They convey the feelings of loss, displacement, and struggle that came with the war, providing a unique perspective that complements more traditional and political historical accounts.\n\nAdditionally, her poetry reflects the thoughts and values of the American Dutch aristocracy and contributes to our understanding of the culture of that era. By examining her work, historians can better understand the perspectives and experiences of individuals from this social class during a time of immense upheaval and change.\n\nIn conclusion, Ann Eliza Bleecker's pastoral poetry helps historians paint a richer, more nuanced picture of life during the American Revolution. It allows them to explore the personal and emotional dimensions of the war, shedding light on the day-to-day realities faced by ordinary people who were swept up in this momentous historical event.

In addition to this, ISI announced the launch of its Mandarin Chinese immersion program for students in the same year.\n\nIn 2014, ISI was recognized by The Washington Post as one of the most challenging high schools in the country, due to the enduring nature of the IB Diploma Programme and the fact that all students are required to sit for these college-level exams at the end of their senior year.\n\nThe launch of the ONE ISI campaign in 2019 established the school's intention to unify the Lower and Upper School campuses by the 2021-22 academic year.\n\nOne of six like-minded international schools in the United States, ISI offers an integrated International Baccalaureate curriculum that is transferable to schools around the world.  The ISI curriculum imparts the problem-solving skills students need in the 21st-century economy.\n\nCampus\nThe school campus is situated in the Butler-Tarkington neighborhood of Indianapolis, with the majority of the facilities situated on 60 wooded acres north of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Grades 6 through 12 are located at 4330 Michigan Road, and pre-kindergarten through Grade 5 classes are held at the school's 49th Street building.\n\nCurriculum\nThe school has an accredited IB Diploma Programme, Middle Years Programme, and the Primary Years Programme.\n\nISI is the only school in the Midwest where all of its upper school students participate in the full International Baccalaureate Diploma programme.\n\nExtracurricular activities\nStudent groups and activities include the Aid to Congo Project, Habitat for Humanity, Literary Arts Society, Model United Nations, an Oxfam banquet, student government, the Timmy Foundation, the Gryphon Voices choir, art club, yearbook and sports.\n\nDiversity\n\nISI has always been renowned for being one of the most diverse private high schools in the state of Indiana, with the Indiana Department of Education reporting the following ethnic breakdown for the 2019-2020 school year: 44.5% White, 27.4% Asian, 9.1% Hispanic, 9.1% Black, 8.5% Multiracial, 0.6% Pacific Islander, and 0.6% Native American.\n\nIn addition to hosting a variety of different cultures across campus, ISI has always embraced pursuing an economically diverse student body, with 40% of students receiving financial aid of some kind in 2019.\n\nHeads of School \n Alain Weber: 1994-2007\n David Garner: 2007-2018\n Craig P.

Simple lie groups are a special type of mathematical objects that help us understand the structure and properties of many other mathematical structures. In simple terms, a simple lie group is a connected, non-abelian lie group that has no nontrivial connected normal subgroups. This means it can't be broken down into smaller connected normal subgroups, making it somewhat \"atomic\" or indivisible.\n\nSimple lie groups can be used to find simple lie algebras and riemannian symmetric spaces.

As a result, this classification is often called killing-cartan classification. The connected simple lie groups with trivial center (meaning no elements other than the identity) are at the core of this classification. Once these are known, simple lie groups with non-trivial center can be easily found.\n\nIt's important to note that there are different definitions of simple lie groups, and they do not necessarily have to be simple as abstract groups. However, a commonly accepted definition involves being connected, non-abelian, and having either the identity or the whole group as closed connected normal subgroups. \n\n<user> That's interesting! can you elaborate more on why it's crucial to understand simple lie groups? and, how do classical lie groups fit into this picture, providing a group-theoretic framework for various geometries like spherical and projective geometry? \n\n<assistant> Understanding simple lie groups is essential because they serve as building blocks for more complex lie groups, allowing us to study and analyse them more effectively. By knowing the properties of simple lie groups, we can gain insights into the structure and behaviors of other mathematical objects.\n\nClassical lie groups are a category of simple lie groups that support geometrical concepts like spherical and projective geometry. They align with felix klein's erlangen program, connecting group theory and geometry. These classical groups provide an underlying structure for different geometries, enabling a better understanding of their properties and relations. \n\n<user> Thank you for the explanation! can you give me some examples of simple lie groups and their roles in different areas of mathematics or applications? also, could you please tell me more about the exceptional possibilities in the classification of simple lie groups that are not tied to any familiar geometry? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Some examples of simple lie groups include special linear group sl(n), which consists of n x n matrices with determinant equal to 1. For n > 1, sl(n) is a simple lie group. These groups are used in various areas, such as geometry, physics, and cryptography.\n\nAnother example is the unitary group u(n), which consists of n x n unitary matrices. Simple lie groups like su(n), the special unitary group, are important in areas like quantum mechanics and particle physics.\n\nRegarding exceptional possibilities, while most simple lie groups correspond to familiar geometries, a few do not. These are known as exceptional lie groups, and they include five groups: g2, f4, e6, e7, and e8. These groups don't follow classical geometries, making them extraordinary and harder to understand. They have applications in areas like theoretical physics, algebraic geometry, and string theory. The deep understanding of these exceptional groups remains an ongoing area of research in mathematics.

        "reference": "In mathematics, a simple Lie group is a connected non-abelian Lie group G which does not have nontrivial connected normal subgroups. The list of simple Lie groups can be used to read off the list of simple Lie algebras and Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\nTogether with the commutative Lie group of the real numbers, , and that of the unit-magnitude complex numbers, U(1) (the unit circle), simple Lie groups give the atomic \"blocks\" that make up all (finite-dimensional) connected Lie groups via the operation of group extension. Many commonly encountered Lie groups are either simple or 'close' to being simple: for example, the so-called \"special linear group\" SL(n) of n by n matrices with determinant equal to 1 is simple for all n > 1.\n\nThe simple Lie groups were first classified by Wilhelm Killing and later perfected by Élie Cartan. This classification is often referred to as Killing-Cartan classification.\n\nDefinition\nUnfortunately, there is no universally accepted definition of a simple Lie group. In particular, it is not always defined as a Lie group that is simple as an abstract group. Authors differ on whether a simple Lie group has to be connected, or on whether it is allowed to have a non-trivial center, or on whether  is a simple Lie group.\n\nThe most common definition is that a Lie group is simple if it is connected, non-abelian, and every closed connected normal subgroup is either the identity or the whole group. In particular, simple groups are allowed to have a non-trivial center, but  is not simple.\n\nIn this article the connected simple Lie groups with trivial center are listed.  Once these are known, the ones with non-trivial center are easy to list as follows. Any simple Lie group with trivial center has a universal cover, whose center is the fundamental group of the simple Lie group. The corresponding simple Lie groups with non-trivial center can be obtained as quotients of this universal cover by a subgroup of the center.\n\nAlternatives\nAn equivalent definition of a simple Lie group follows from the Lie correspondence: A connected Lie group is simple if its Lie algebra is simple. An important technical point is that a simple Lie group may contain discrete normal subgroups, hence being a simple Lie group is different from being simple as an abstract group.\n\nSimple Lie groups include many classical Lie groups, which provide a group-theoretic underpinning for spherical geometry, projective geometry and related geometries in the sense of Felix Klein's Erlangen program. It emerged in the course of classification of simple Lie groups that there exist also several exceptional possibilities not corresponding to any familiar geometry.",

To score, a team must shoot the ball into the opponent's goal, which is suspended two meters above the water.\n\nA canoe polo game consists of two 7- to 10-minute halves, with a 1- to 3-minute half-time break. The pitch boundaries are ideally marked with floating ropes, measuring 35 meters by 23 meters.\n\nThe \"zone\" is an area approximately 6 meters in front of each goal. Defending players create formations in the zone to prevent the attacking team from scoring.\n\nThere are two referees on foot, one on each sideline.

The tactics and playing of the game are not unlike basketball or water polo but with the added complexity of the boats, which can be used to tackle an opposition player in possession of the ball, or jostle for position within 6 meters of the goal.\n\nOfficials \nThere are two referees (one on each side-line) and they are on foot rather than in boats. The score is kept by the scorekeeper and the timekeeper monitors the playing time and sending-off times. The goal lines are monitored by two line judges. Before play commences scrutineers check all kit for compliance with regulations.\n\nPitch \nCanoe polo is played either indoors in swimming pools or outdoors on a pitch which should measure 35 meters by 23 meters. The boundaries of the pitch are ideally marked using floating ropes (similar to lane markers in swimming), although for smaller venues the edges of the pool are frequently used.\n\nThe area approximately 6 meters in front of each the goal can be defined as the Zone.

In 2004, interbrew and ambev merged to create inbev, the world's largest brewer at that time. This merger combined top brands from belgium, canada, germany, and brazil.\n\nIn 2008, inbev acquired american brewer anheuser-busch for $52 billion, forming anheuser-busch inbev. This expanded inbev's position as the world's largest brewer and created one of the top five consumer products companies. Over the years, ab inbev has continued to grow through various acquisitions, such as harbin brewery (2004), fujian sedrin brewery (2006), and energy drink company hiball (2017). In 2016, ab inbev merged with south african competitor sabmiller, further strengthening its position as the world's largest brewer. \n\n<user> Ab inbev's partnership with a cannabis producer and their affiliation with the international alliance for responsible drinking? \n\n<assistant> In december 2018, ab inbev formed a partnership with cannabis producer tilray, aiming to research cannabis-infused non-alcoholic beverages. They planned to work together on this research through tilray's subsidiary, high park company. This partnership is focused on exploring the potential for non-alcoholic beverages containing thc, cbd, or a combination of both, in response to the growing interest in cannabis-related products.\n\nAnheuser-busch inbev also takes part in responsible consumption initiatives. In 2013, it joined other alcohol producers in signing the international alliance for responsible drinking's producers' commitments. These commitments are a part of an initiative aimed at reducing harmful drinking by promoting responsible consumption practices and cooperating with various stakeholders to address alcohol-related issues. By participating in this initiative, ab inbev demonstrates its commitment to social responsibility and promoting a healthier and safer environment for consumers. \n\n<user> How did ambev become such a big company in latin america and the caribbean? \n\n<assistant> Ambev, or companhia de bebidas das américas, became a major player in the latin america and the caribbean region through a strategic merger and its strong brands. In 1999, the two biggest brazilian brewing companies, antarctica (established in 1880) and brahma (established in 1886), decided to merge, creating ambev. This combination of resources and expertise allowed the new company to have a dominant position in latin america and the caribbean. \n\nAmbev grew and expanded further by focusing on popular beverage brands and establishing a leading presence in the market. Their products appealed to a wide range of consumers, both within brazil and in neighboring countries. Ambev's success eventually led them to merge with interbrew in 2004, forming inbev, the world's largest brewer at that time. This merger amplified their global footprint and further reinforced their presence in the latin american and caribbean markets. \n\n<user> What happened to SABMiller after the merger with AB InBev? \n\n<assistant> After the successful merger with ab inbev in october 2016, sabmiller ceased trading on global stock markets.

It has approximately 630 beer brands in 150 countries.\n\nAB InBev was formed through InBev (itself a merger between Interbrew from Belgium and AmBev from Brazil) acquiring Anheuser-Busch from the United States.\n\nIn October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire South African multinational competitor SABMiller; the merger was concluded in October 2016. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods companies in the world. The annual sales for the company in 2019 were US$52.3 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016. The company was expected to have a 28 percent market share of global volume beer sales in 2017, according to Euromonitor International.\n\nSABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to the Japanese beverage corporation Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the American beverage group Coca-Cola Company.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexico City Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.\n\nHistory \nAB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew. \n Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. And, the Piedboeuf brewery established by 1812. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.\n AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or \"Beverages Company of the Americas\") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).\n Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri, US as Anheuser & Co.\n\nIn 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev. The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.\n\nAnheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer, in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.\n\nIn 2008, the acquisition by InBev of Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser-Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for US$70 per share in cash, for an aggregate of US$52 billion.\n\nIn 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined other alcohol producers in signing the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking's producers' commitments, an initiative to reducing harmful drinking.\n\nOn 21 July 2017, Anheuser-Busch InBev continued its investment in the non-alcohol beverage sector with the purchase of energy drink company Hiball.\n\nIn December 2018, Anheuser-Busch InBev partnered with cannabis producer Tilray to begin researching cannabis infused non-alcoholic beverages with Tilray subsidiary, High Park Company.\n\nTakeovers \nThe following is a diagram of AB InBev's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors, produced prior to the acquisition of SABMiller.\n\nInterbrew \n\nAfter the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, the second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.\n\nIn 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck's & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an initial public offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).\n\nIn 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K.

In the priority rule, reasons for choosing between gambles are examined in this order: minimum gain, chance of minimum gain, and maximum gain. The stopping rule determines when to stop comparing factors - either when minimum gains differ by 1/10 (or more) of the maximum gain or when chances differ by 10% (or more). Finally, the decision rule chooses the gamble with the more attractive gain (chance).\n\nThis heuristic can predict the majority choice in many classic decision-making problems like the allais paradox or the certainty effect by using this simple, structured approach to evaluate and compare gambles. Let me provide examples in the next response. \n\n<user> Thanks for the explanation! can you please give detailed examples of how the priority heuristic is applied to decision-making problems like the allais paradox, and other choice problems like the one you mentioned, which were developed to support prospect theory? i'd appreciate it if you could describe the problems and how the priority heuristic can predict majority choices. \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Let's look at two choice problems designed to support prospect theory and see how the priority heuristic predicts the majority choices.\n\nProblem 1:\nGamble a: 80% chance to win 4,000; 20% chance to win nothing.\nGamble b: 100% chance to win 3,000.\n\nMost people choose b (80%). The priority heuristic compares the minimum gains (0 for a and 3,000 for b). The difference is 3,000, which exceeds 400 (10% of the maximum gain). Examination stops, and people are predicted to prefer the sure gain b, aligning with the majority choice.\n\nProblem 2:\nGamble c: 45% chance to win 6,000; 55% chance to win nothing.\nGamble d: 90% chance to win 3,000; 10% chance to win nothing.\n\nMost people choose d (86%). The priority heuristic compares minimum gains (0 and 0), leading to a comparison of probabilities (0.45 and 0.90). This difference exceeds 10%, so examination stops, and people are predicted to choose d due to its higher probability of winning.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the predictive power of the priority heuristic in decision-making problems and its ability to capture behavioral patterns observed in classic experiments. \n\n<user> I'm still a bit confused about these steps and rules of the priority heuristic. can you please explain them to me in simpler terms or like you would to a child? would it be possible to provide a basic example to help me understand the concept better? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Let me explain the priority heuristic in simpler terms.\n\nImagine you're choosing between two mystery boxes, and each box gives you a prize. The prizes can be toys, and the priority heuristic helps you decide which box to pick. The steps are:\n\n1. Priority rule: you check three things in order: the least cool toy (minimum gain), the chance of getting the least cool toy (chance of minimum gain), and the coolest toy (maximum gain).\n\n2. Stopping rule: you stop checking when you find a big enough difference between boxes. For example, if one box has way cooler toys (1/10 or more of the coolest toy), or if one box has a much higher chance (10% or more) of giving you the least cool toy.\n\n3. Decision rule: you pick the box with the cooler toys (higher gain) or the box with a smaller chance of giving you the least cool toy.\n\nNow, let's say you have two mystery boxes:\n\nBox a: 8/10 chance of getting a cool robot; 2/10 chance of getting an empty box.\nBox b: 10/10 chance of getting a neat action figure.\n\nWith the priority heuristic, you check the least cool prize, (empty box for a and action figure for b). The difference (empty vs. Action figure) is big enough, so you stop and choose box b because it has a cooler guaranteed prize.\n\nThis simple example demonstrates the steps of the priority heuristic while making it easier to understand for a younger audience. \n\n<user> Is the priority heuristic always accurate in predicting people's choices? What are some of its limitations and criticisms? \n\n<assistant> While the priority heuristic correctly predicted the majority choice in all one-stage gambles in kahneman and tversky's 1979 study and outperformed other decision-making models, it does have limitations and has faced criticisms.\n\nFirst, the priority heuristic may fail to predict simple decisions that are typically not tested in experiments. Since real-life decisions often contain nuance and complexity, the heuristic may fall short when applied to broader contexts.\n\nSecond, the priority heuristic has no free parameters. This means it cannot account for variations in decision-making between individuals, as it assumes uniformity in the cognitive process among people.\n\nThis lack of flexibility can undermine the predictive accuracy of the model for specific individuals or subpopulations, leading to deviations from the majority choice.\n\nCritics argue that such simplifications can misrepresent the true complexity of human decision-making processes. However, supporters of the priority heuristic counter that it's crucial to understand its strengths, as it offers a simple and effective way of capturing a substantial portion of human choices in laboratory settings.\n\nIn summary, the priority heuristic shows promise in predicting certain decision-making patterns, but it's essential to recognize its limitations when considering its applicability across diverse contexts and individual differences.

        "reference": "The priority heuristic is a simple, lexicographic decision strategy that correctly predicts classic violations of expected utility theory such as the Allais paradox, the four-fold pattern, the certainty effect, the possibility effect, or intransitivities. \n\nThe heuristic maps onto Rubinstein’s three-step model, according to which people first check dominance and stop if it is present, otherwise they check for dissimilarity. To highlight Rubinstein’s model consider the following choice problem:\n\nI: 50% chance to win 2,000\n50% chance to win nothing\n\nII: 52% chance to win 1,000\n48% chance to win nothing\n\nDominance is absent, and while chances are similar monetary outcomes are not. Rubinstein’s model predicts that people check for dissimilarity and consequently choose Gamble I. Unfortunately, dissimilarity checks are often not decisive, and Rubinstein suggested that people proceed to a third step that he left unspecified. The priority heuristic elaborates on Rubinstein’s framework by specifying this Step 3.\n\nPriority heuristic \nFor illustrative purposes consider a choice between two simple gambles of the type “a chance c of winning monetary amount x; a chance (100 - c) of winning amount y.” A choice between two such gambles contain four reasons for choosing: the maximum gain, the minimum gain, and their respective chances; because chances are complementary, three reasons remain: the minimum gain, the chance of the minimum gain, and the maximum gain.\n\nFor choices between gambles in which all outcomes are positive or 0, the priority heuristic consists of the following three steps (for all other choices see Brandstätter et al. 2006):\n\nPriority rule: Go through reasons in the order of minimum gain, the chance of minimum gain, and maximum gain.\n\nStopping rule: Stop examination if the minimum gains differ by 1/10 (or more) of the maximum gain; otherwise, stop examination if chances differ by 10% (or more).\n\nDecision rule: Choose the gamble with the more attractive gain (chance). The term “attractive” refers to the gamble with the higher (minimum or maximum) gain and to the lower chance of the minimum gain.\n\nExamples \nConsider the following two choice problems, which were developed to support prospect theory, not the priority heuristic.\n\nProblem 1\nA: 80% chance to win 4,000\n20% chance to win nothing\nB: 100% chance to win 3,000\n\nMost people chose B (80%). The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains of the Gambles A (0) and B (3,000). The difference is 3,000, which is larger than 400 (10% of the maximum gain), the examination is stopped; and the heuristic predicts that people prefer the sure gain B, which is in fact the majority choice.A\n\nProblem 2\nC: 45% chance to win 6,000\n55% chance to win nothing\nD: 90% chance to win 3,000 \n10% chance to win nothing\n\nMost people (86%) chose Gamble D. The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains (0 and 0). Because they do not differ, the probabilities (.45 and .90 or their logical complements .55 and .10) are compared. This difference is larger than 10%, examination stops and people are correctly predicted to choose D because of its higher probability of winning.\n\nEmpirical support and limitations \nThe priority heuristic correctly predicted the majority choice in all (one-stage) gambles in Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Across four different data sets with a total of 260 problems, the heuristic predicted the majority choice better than (a) cumulative prospect theory, (b) two other modifications of expected utility theory, and (c) ten well-known heuristics (such as minimax or equal-weight) did. However, the priority heuristic fails to predict many simple decisions (that are typically not tested in experiments) and has no free parameters (which means that it cannot explain the heterogeneity of decisions between subjects), which triggered criticism,\nand countercriticism.\n\nSee also\n Mathematics\n Economics\n Combinatorics\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/eb/EB_Priority_2006.pdf\n\nHeuristics",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you describe the morphology and staining characteristics of mycobacterium bovis bacteria? \n\n<assistant> Mycobacterium bovis (M. Bovis) is a bacterium that causes tuberculosis in cattle. It has a slow-growing aerobic nature, with a 16- to 20-hour generation time. Morphologically, M. Bovis bacteria appear as curved or straight rods and can sometimes form filaments that break into bacilli or cocci when disturbed. They do not have flagella, fimbria, or a capsule. The size of bacteria from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis group is typically 1.0-4.0µm long by 0.2-0.3µm wide in tissues. In culture, they may appear as cocci or bacilli up to 6-8µm long.\n\nM. Bovis is a Gram-positive, acid-fast bacterium. The cell wall is composed of up to 60% lipid, which contributes to its hydrophobic characteristics, slow growth, and resistance to various environmental factors. Staining with analine dyes is difficult for M. Bovis, but its acid-fast nature can be confirmed using the Ziehl-Neelsen staining method. The bacteria stain pink with hot carbol fuschin and resist decolorization with 3% hydrochloric acid in 95% alcohol. Following washing, the slide is counterstained with methylene blue or another suitable dye. These bacteria are non-spore-forming. \n\n<user> What are the growth requirements and appearance of colonies for m. bovis in culture? additionally, how is m.bovis distinct in structure and metabolism compared to m.tberea? \n\n<assistant> M. Bovis is a facultative intracellular parasite. For in vitro growth, it requires special culture media. An example is dorset's egg medium, which contains ingredients such as egg yolk, phosphate buffer, magnesium salts, and sodium pyruvate. Amino acids may be added, but glycerol is not included as it is inhibitory. The growth of m. Bovis usually takes several weeks at 37°c to reach colonies visible to the naked eye. It is strictly aerobic and doesn't grow at 25°c, with optimal growth occurring at 37-38°c. M. Bovis doesn't reduce nitrate or niacin and is resistant to pyrazinamide while being sensitive to thiophene-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide.\n\nThe appearance of colonies after 3-4 weeks of growth starts as minute, dull flakes which then thicken to form dry, irregular masses standing above the culture medium surface. Eventually, this grows over the entire medium surface, forming a rough, waxy blanket that becomes thick and wrinkled. Colonies are initially yellow and darken to deep yellow or brick red when exposed to light. In liquid media, growth only occurs on the surface, unless a wetting agent like tween 80 is added.\n\nM. Bovis has a similar structure and metabolism to m. Tuberculosis; however, there are differences. M. Bovis lacks pyruvate kinase activity due to a point mutation in pyka that affects binding of the mg2+ cofactor. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the last step of glycolysis, so when m. Bovis is unable to enter oxidative metabolism, it must rely on alternative carbon sources like amino acids or fatty acids for energy metabolism. \n\n<user> How was m. bovis historically significant in terms of animal farming? and in what ways is it transmitted and controlled nowadays? \n\n<assistant> Historically, during the first half of the 20th century, m. Bovis was a significant concern in animal farming, being responsible for more losses among farm animals than all other infectious diseases combined. M. Bovis infection typically occurred upon ingestion or inhalation of the bacterium.\n\nNowadays, m. Bovis transmission to humans is primarily through consuming raw milk from infected cows or via aerosol droplets. Infections in developed countries are rare due to pasteurization, which kills the bacteria in infected milk. In the uk, for example, cattle are tested for m. Bovis as part of an eradication program, and those that test positive are culled. The carcasses are inspected and certified as fit for human consumption before they enter the food chain. However, in developing countries where pasteurization is not commonplace, m. Bovis remains a relatively common cause of human tuberculosis. \n\n<user> Even with pasteurization and other precautions, how can m. bovis still potentially pose a threat to human health in developed countries and what measures can be taken to further mitigate the risk? \n\n<assistant> Although pasteurization and eradication programs have significantly reduced the risk of m. Bovis infection in developed countries, there is still a possibility of transmission. The potential risks can come from consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, contact with infected animals, or exposure to environments contaminated with the bacterium. Additionally, international travel can increase the chance of exposure to infected animals or products from regions where m. Bovis is more prevalent.\n\nTo further mitigate the risk of m. Bovis infection in developed countries, the following measures can be considered:\n\n1. Public education and awareness about the risks associated with consuming raw or unpasteurized dairy products.\n2. Strengthening surveillance and testing programs for livestock, ensuring timely identification and culling of infected animals.\n3. Implementing biosecurity measures, proper disposal of animal waste, and hygiene protocols at farms to minimize the spread of the bacterium.\n4. Promoting collaboration and information sharing between countries or regions, regarding the status of m. Bovis infections and control measures.\n5. Encouraging safe handling practices during animal processing and butchery, minimizing the exposure risk for workers in these sectors.\n6. If traveling to regions where m.

        "reference": "Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) is a slow-growing (16- to 20-hour generation time) aerobic bacterium and the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle (known as bovine TB). It is related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium which causes tuberculosis in humans. M. bovis can jump the species barrier and cause tuberculosis-like infection in humans and other mammals.\n\nBacterium morphology and staining \n\nThe bacteria are curved or straight rods. They sometimes form filaments, which fragment into bacilli or cocci once disturbed. In tissues they form slender rods, straight or curved, or club-shaped.\nShort, relatively plump bacilli (rods) in tissue smears, large slender beaded rods in culture. They have no flagella or fimbria, and no capsule.\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis group bacteria are 1.0-4.0µm long by 0.2-0.3 µm wide in tissues. In culture, they may appear as cocci, or as bacilli up to 6-8 µm long.\n\nThe bacteria stain Gram-positive, acid-fast. The cell wall contains as high as 60% lipid, giving the mycobacteria their hydrophobic characteristics, slow growth, and resistance to desiccation, disinfectants, acids and antibodies. (Mycobacterium family). They are not easy to stain with analine dyes; although they are Gram positive, confirming this may be difficult. Ziehl–Neelsen staining results in stain pink with hot carbol fuscin and then resist decolourisation with 3% hydrochloric acid in 95% alcohol (i.e. they are acid-alcohol fast); following washing, the slide is counterstained with e.g. methylene blue.\n\nThey are nonspore-forming.\n\nCulture and biochemical features\n\nGrowth requirements\nM. bovis is a facultative intracellular parasite. For in vitro growth, special culture media are required; for example, Dorset's egg medium incorporates egg yolk, phosphate buffer, magnesium salts, and sodium pyruvate; amino acids may be added, but glycerol is not included, as it is inhibitory. It is inhibited by glycerine. Culture generally requires several weeks at 37°C to reach colonies visible to the unaided human eye. It is strictly aerobic, and grows at 37, but not at 25°C. Optimal growth occurs at 37-38°C. The species does not reduce nitrate or niacin, and is resistant to pyrazinamide. It is sensitive to thiophene-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide.\n\nAppearance of colonies\nInitially (after 3–4 weeks), its minute, dull flakes, begin to thicken to form dry, irregular masses standing high above the culture medium surface. Eventually, confluent growth is seen over the whole culture surface, forming a rough, waxy blanket, becoming thick and wrinkled and reaching up the sides of the container. Colonies are yellow when first visible, darkening to deep yellow and eventually brick red, if exposed to light. In fluid media, growth is on the surface only, unless a wetting agent (e.g. Tween 80) is added to the medium.\n\nCell structure and metabolism \nM. bovis is similar in structure and metabolism to M. tuberculosis. M. bovis is a Gram-positive, acid-fast, rod-shaped, aerobic bacterium. Unlike M. tuberculosis, M. bovis lacks pyruvate kinase activity, due to pykA containing a point mutation that affects binding of Mg2+ cofactor. Pyruvate kinase catalyses the final step of glycolysis, the dephosphorylation of phosphorenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Therefore, in M. bovis, glycolytic intermediates are unable to enter into oxidative metabolism. Although no specific studies have been performed,  M. bovis seemingly must rely on amino acids or fatty acids as an alternative carbon source for energy metabolism.\n\nPathogenesis\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, M. bovis is estimated to have been responsible for more losses among farm animals than all other infectious diseases combined. Infection occurs if the bacterium is ingested or inhaled.\n\nM. bovis is usually transmitted to humans by consuming raw milk from infected cows, although it can also spread via aerosol droplets. Actual infections in humans are nowadays rare in developed countries, mainly because pasteurisation kills M. bovis bacteria in infected milk. In the UK, cattle are tested for the disease as part of an eradication program and culled if they test positive. Such cattle can still enter the human food chain, but only after a meat inspector or a government veterinary surgeon has inspected the carcass and certified that it is fit for human consumption.  However, in areas of the developing world where pasteurisation is not routine, M. bovis is a relatively common cause of human tuberculosis.",

Nut protein facilitates the acetylation of chromatin by histone acetyltransferase ep300 in testicular spermatids, which are cells that mature into sperms. This acetylation is a chromatin remodeling process that is crucial for spermatogenesis, the maturation of spermatids into sperm.\n\nEvidence shows that male mice lacking the nutm1 gene have abnormally small testes, lack sperm in their cauda epididymis, and are completely sterile. This suggests that the nutm1 gene may have a similar role in human male fertility.\n\nIn certain cancers, nutm1 has been implicated in the development of epithelial cell cancers in young people, with rapidly fatal outcomes. These cancers are associated with a fusion gene called brd4-nutm1, which forms due to a large-scale mutation such as chromosomal translocation. The brd4-nut protein product of this fusion gene is believed to promote neoplasms by maintaining neoplastic cells in a perpetually undifferentiated, proliferative state. \n\n<user> That sounds interesting! how exactly does the brd4-nut protein affect those neoplastic cells, and does it influence the expression of some important genes? are there any potential therapeutic targets that could be developed for the treatment of the cancers associated with the brd4-nutm fusion gene? \n\n<assistant> The brd4-nut protein affects neoplastic cells by maintaining them in a perpetually undifferentiated, proliferative state, which contributes to the development of neoplasms. It does so by stimulating the expression of at least four oncogenes (cancer-promoting genes): myc, tp63, sox2, and myb. Overexpression of myc and sox2 can also maintain cells in an undifferentiated stem cell-like state, resembling the cells found in the neoplasms driven by the brd4-nutm1 fusion gene.\n\nTargeting these overexpressed genes or their products could potentially offer therapeutic options for treating cancers associated with the brd4-nutm1 fusion gene. Further research is needed to validate and expand upon these findings, as well as to determine if any of the overexpressed gene products contribute to the development, progression, or can serve as targets for the treatment of these neoplasms.\n\nAdditionally, nutm1's involvement in a wide range of neoplasms when fused to other genes presents new opportunities to explore therapeutic targets and treatments for these specific cancer types. \n\n<user> I'm curious about how the fusion gene forms and leads to the formation of the brd4-nut protein. can you provide more details about the process, including any specific notation used to describe this translocation? and how does the normal function of the brd4 gene play a role in this abnormal fusion, if at all? \n\n<assistant> The brd4-nutm1 fusion gene arises from a large-scale mutation, such as a chromosomal translocation. In this specific case, parts of the nutm1 gene, located in band 14 on the long (\"q\") arm of chromosome 15, merge with parts of the brd4 gene, located in band 13 on the short (\"p\") arm of chromosome 19. This abnormal fusion results in the formation of a new gene, encoding a fusion protein called brd4-nut. The translocation is notated as t(15;19)(q13, p13.1), which describes the exchange of genetic material between chromosome 15 and chromosome 19.\n\nThe normal brd4 gene encodes the brd4 protein, which recognizes acetylated lysine residues on proteins and participates in the regulation of dna replication and transcription. Through these processes, brd4 protein is involved in key cellular processes that can lead to the development of neoplasms, which are malignant or benign tissue growths.\n\nIn the brd4-nut fusion protein, the normal function of the brd4 protein is disrupted. The fusion protein retains the ability to recognize acetylated lysine residues but gains additional properties due to the fusion with the nutm1 gene's product. This results in the promotion of neoplasms by maintaining the neoplastic cells in a perpetually undifferentiated and proliferative state. Consequently, the function of the brd4 gene plays a significant role in the formation and action of the brd4-nut protein due to its fusion with the nutm1 gene.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms through which the fusion protein operates and identifying potential therapeutic targets are critical for developing effective treatments for neoplasms associated with the brd4-nutm1 fusion gene or other similar fusion genes involving the nutm1 gene.

NUT protein facilitates the acetylation of chromatin (i.e. DNA-protein bundles) by histone acetyltransferase EP300 in testicular spermatids (cells that mature into sperms). This acetylation is a form of chromatin remodeling which compacts spermatid chromatin, a critical step required for the normal conduct of spermatogenesis, i.e. the maturation of spermatids into sperm. Male mice that lacked the mouse Nutm1 gene using a gene knockout method had abnormally small  testes, lacked sperm in their cauda epididymis (i.e. tail of the epididymis which contains sperm in fertile male mice), and were completely sterile. These findings  indicate that Nutm1 gene is essential for the development of normal fertility in male mice and suggest that the NUTM1 gene may play a similar role in  men.\n\nThe NUTM1 gene is located in band 14 on the long (or \"q\") arm of chromosome 15. In the early 1990's, this gene was implicated in the development of certain epithelial cell cancers that: a) occurred in the midline structures of young people, b) were rapidly fatal, and c) consisted of poorly differentiated (i.e. not resembling any particular cell type), immature-appearing cells containing a BRD4-NUTM1 fusion gene. BRD4 is the bromodomain-containing protein 4 gene. A fusion gene is an abnormal gene consisting of parts from two different genes that form as a result of a large scale gene mutation such as a chromosomal translocation, interstitial deletion, or inversion. The BRD4-NUTM1 fusion gene is a translocation that encodes a fusion protein that has merged most of the protein coding region of the NUTM1 gene with a large part of the BRD4 gene located in band 13 on the short (i.e. \"q\") arm of chromosome 19. This translocation is notated as t(15;19)(q13, p13.1).    \n\nBRD4 protein recognizes acetylated lysine residues on proteins and by doing so participates in the regulation of DNA replication, DNA transcription, and thereby key cellular processes involved in the development of neoplasms (i.e. malignant or benign tissue growths). The product of  the BRD4-NUTM1 fusion gene, BRD4-NUT protein, stimulates the expression of at least 4 relevant genes, MYC, TP63, SOX2, and MYB in cultured cells. All four of these genes are oncogenes, i.e., genes that when overexpressed and/or overly active promote the development of certain types of cancers. Overexpression of the MYC and SOX2 genes can also act to maintain cells in an undifferentiated stem cell-like state similar to the cells in the neoplasms driven by the BRD4-NUTM1 fusion gene. It is generally accepted that the BRD4-NUT protein promotes these neoplasms by maintaining their neoplastic cells in a perpetually undifferentiated, proliferative state. Further studies are needed to confirm and expand these views and to determine if any of the  overexpressed gene products of the of the BRD4-NUT protein contribute to the development and/or progression, or can serve as targets for the treatment, of the neoplasms associated with the BRD4-NUTM fusion gene. These questions also apply to a wide range of neoplasms that have more recently been associated with the NUTM1 gene fused to other genes.",

At this neolithic site, around 16,000 human bones and 725 bird bones were uncovered, most of which belonged to the white-tailed sea eagle (haliaeetus albicilla).\n\nResearchers believe that the human bodies were exposed to the elements to remove flesh before being placed in the tomb. This practice, called \"sky burial\" or \"excarnation,\" allowed scavengers, particularly birds, to clean the bones. The presence of a significant number of eagle bones suggests that these birds of prey played a role in this process. The tomb itself was in use for over a millennium, indicating the cultural significance of the site.\n\nThe tomb of the eagles provides valuable insights into neolithic burial customs and the relationship between humans and eagles in the orkney islands at the time. \n\n<user> Boys' ploughing match. what do they do in it? \n\n<assistant> The boys' ploughing match is a fun and unique annual event held in st.

It is linked to the Orkney Mainland by the Churchill Barriers, running via Burray, Glimps Holm and Lamb Holm.\n\nName\nAlong with North Ronaldsay, the island is named after St Ronald. The original name from which the English name derives, Rǫgnvaldsey, comes from Old Norse; Rǫgnvalds (\"Ronald's\") + ey (\"island\").\n\nGeography and geology\nWith an area of , it is the fourth largest of the Orkney islands after The Mainland, Hoy and Sanday. Ferries sail from Burwick on the island to John o' Groats on the Scottish mainland and from St Margaret's Hope to Gills Bay.\n\nSouth Ronaldsay's main village is St Margaret's Hope, Orkney's third largest settlement. It is named either after Margaret, Maid of Norway, the heir to the Scottish throne who died in Orkney age seven or possibly St. Margaret.  The village has a small blacksmith's museum and is known for its annual Boys' Ploughing Match. During this event young girls and boys dressed in dark jackets play the part of the horses and young boys using miniature ploughs compete with one another at ploughing a 4-foot square rig in the nearby sands.\n\nThe cardinal points of the island are Ayre of Cara, by Churchill Barrier no. 4 (north), Grimness (east), Brough Ness, (south) and Hoxa Head, (west). The highest elevation is Ward Hill, which reaches . This name is common one in Orkney for the highest point on an island and comes from the  historic use of these places used for the lighting of warning beacons.\n\nPrehistory\n\nThe island is known for the Neolithic Isbister Chambered Cairn, popularly known as the \"Tomb of the Eagles\". Discovered by Ronald Simison in 1958 in the south east of the island, 16,000 human bones and 725 bird bones were found at the site, the latter predominantly belonging to the White-tailed Sea Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla). The evidence suggests that  the human bodies had been exposed to the elements to remove the flesh before burial. The tomb was in continuous use for a millennium or more.\n\nThe burnt mound at nearby Liddle, discovered by Simison in 1972, is the best example of a Bronze Age cooking place in Orkney. Made of flat slabs originally sealed with clay, the central stone trough would have been filled with water heated by stones using peat as a fuel. The building was probably roofless.\n\nThere is a broch site at Howe of Hoxa in the north west that may have been the burial place of Thorfinn \"Skullsplitter\".\n\nHistory\nIn 1627 nine chapels were recorded on the island with some of the names hinting at the existence of Christian worship prior to the Norse conquest of Orkney.",

The green grotto caves are named for the green algae that cover their walls, lending them their distinctive appearance. Located on the north coast of jamaica, these show caves are a popular tourist attraction. One interesting aspect of their structure is that they are flank margin caves – old mixing chambers at the edge of the fresh water lens with the sea water – and have two well-defined levels, which seem to indicate two periods with differing sea-levels. The innermost cavern houses a crystal-clear underground lake.\n\nAside from the public areas, there are \"wild caves\" where the ecology is relatively undisturbed. The cave system is hydrologically connected with the adjacent coastal waters. Throughout history, the green grotto caves have had various names and uses. They were home to arawak indians, served as a hideaway during the british colonization of jamaica, and even provided refuge to escaped slaves. Later, they were utilized during both world wars for smuggling and storage purposes.\n\nIn terms of natural history, nine of jamaica's 21 bat species reside in the caves, along with some marine life in the lower-level brackish water. A fun fact is that the 1973 james bond film \"live and let die\" featured the caves as the villain's underground base. \n\n<user> Were any artifacts found in the caves? \n\n<assistant> Yes, artifacts have been found in the green grotto caves.

Can you please tell me more about it? \n\n<assistant> Of course! The movie your friends mentioned was the 1973 james bond film, \"live and let die.\" the green grotto caves were used to represent the underground base of the villain, doctor kananga, which was located beneath a cemetery on the fictional island of san monique. In the film, james bond, played by roger moore, manages to defeat kananga in the caves. The use of the green grotto caves added an exciting and mysterious element to the movie, making it even more memorable! \n\n<user> What kind of marine life can be found in the lower levels of the green grotto caves? \n\n<assistant> The lower levels of the green grotto caves contain brackish water, which is a mix of fresh and saltwater. Various marine life can be found in this environment. Though detailed documentation may be limited, some examples include small barnacles and unidentified swimming creatures. The presence of these marine organisms adds to the unique and diverse ecosystem of the green grotto caves, contributing to their ecological significance and richness as a tourist attraction. ",

These various groups rejected the doctrines of Sarvāstivāda and Pudgalavada. They were active during the reign of Ashoka, participating in missionary activities in regions like Gandhara, Bactria, Kashmir, South India, and Sri Lanka. By the third century CE, they had spread to Central Asia and South-East Asia. Their doctrines can be found in the Kathavatthu.\n\nThe nomenclature, Vibhajyavāda, consists of two parts: vibhajya, meaning \"dividing\" or \"analyzing,\" and vāda, which signifies \"doctrine\" or \"teachings.\" Their doctrinal emphasis was on the analysis of phenomena (dharmas). They were called \"distinctionists\" since they made distinctions between dhammas that exist in the present and past, and dhammas that don't exist in the past and future, unlike the Sarvāstivāda school.\n\nVibhajyavādins include groups like the Kāśyapīya, Mahīśāsaka, and Dharmaguptaka. They were particularly strong in South India, where they were known as Theriyas. This group survived until the seventeenth century in South India, and in Sri Lanka, they eventually evolved into Theravadins.\n\nThey rejected the Sarvāstivāda claim that all dhammas exist in the past, present, and future. The Vibhajyavādins distinguished between dhammas that \"exist\" and those that don't, believing that dhammas exist only in the present time. \n\n<user> Can you explain their critique of the 'self'? how does it differ from other buddhist beliefs? \n\n<assistant> The term vibhajyavāda means that the doctrine \"distinguishes\" between heterodox and orthodox views, particularly the non-buddhist theory of a self (atman) and the pudgala theory of the pudgalavadins. The key method used by the buddha and early buddhists to break down the idea of self was through analyzing the components of a person and investigating whether these components possess the features that one could ascribe to a self.\n\nVibhajyavāda emphasized the critique of the self in both their analysis of dhamma and as part of their discourse against non-buddhist views. This critique stands apart from their beliefs surrounding dhammas, which serve as the basis for their rejection of sarvāstivāda and pudgalavada doctrines.\n\nThe other buddhist beliefs, such as the sarvāstivāda, propose that all dhammas exist in the past, present, and future, thus marking a critical difference from the vibhajyavādins. The specific focus on analyzing the components of a person and rejecting the notion of self makes the vibhajyavādins' view on this matter distinct from other buddhist doctrines. \n\n<user> What happened to the vibhajyavada over time? \n\n<assistant> Over time, the vibhajyavādins evolved and developed into different groups and lineages. Their influence was particularly strong in south india, where they called themselves theriyas. In sri lanka, they eventually merged into the theravada tradition.\n\nAs theriyas, they managed to survive in south india until the seventeenth century. In central asia and south-east asia, where they had spread by the third century ce, their impact is evident in the development of various regional buddhist traditions.\n\nWhile the specific vibhajyavāda groups might not have survived as distinct lineages into the present day, their ideas, particularly the method of analysis and rejection of the self (atman), contributed to shaping various buddhist schools of thought. Their core beliefs became an essential part of the broader buddhist discourse and were absorbed into the practices and teachings of other factions, mainly the theravada tradition in sri lanka.\n\nThrough this process of evolution and blending with other buddhist sects, the vibhajyavāda's ideas and methodologies became a vital part of the overall development of buddhist thought and continue to inform buddhist practice today.

        "reference": "Vibhajyavāda (; Pāli: Vibhajjavāda; ) is a term applied generally to groups of early Buddhists belonging to the Sthavira Nikaya. These various groups are known to have rejected Sarvāstivāda doctrines (especially the doctrine of \"all exists\") and the doctrine of Pudgalavada (personalism). During the reign of Ashoka, these groups possibly took part in missionary activity in Gandhara, Bactria, Kashmir, South India and Sri Lanka. By the third century CE, they had spread in Central Asia and South-East Asia. Their doctrine is expounded in the Kathavatthu.\n\nNomenclature and etymology\nThe word Vibhajyavāda may be parsed into vibhajya (), loosely meaning \"dividing\", \"analyzing\" and vāda () holding the semantic field: \"doctrine\", \"teachings\". According to Andrew Skilton, the analysis of phenomena (Skt. dharmas) was the doctrinal emphasis and preoccupation of the Vibhajyavādins.\n\nAccording to A.K. Warder, they are called \"distinctionists\" because they make distinctions between dhammas that exist in the present and the past, and dhammas that don't exist in the past and the future (as opposed to Sarvāstivāda). This is supported by the explanation given by the 6th century Mahayana philosopher Bhavaviveka.\n\nAccording to Bhante Sujato, Vibhajyavāda means that the doctrine \"distinguishes\" (vibhajanto) the heterodox and orthodox views, particularly the non-buddhist theory of a self (atman) and also the pudgala theory of the pudgalavadins. The characteristic method used by the Buddha and early Buddhists to break down the idea of self was the method of analyzing (vibhajjati) the components of a person and investigating them to find that they do not possess the features that one could ascribe to a self. Thus, it would make sense that the term refers to \"the Abhidhamma movement as an analytic approach to Dhamma in general, and as a critique of the ‘self’ in particular\".\n\nOverview\n\nThe Vibhajyavādins are a group of early Buddhist schools. According to the Theravada account, this group rejected the Sarvastivada teachings at the third Buddhist council (however modern scholars question the council narratives). The name means \"those who make distinctions,\" and include the Kāśyapīya, Mahīśāsaka and Dharmaguptaka. The Vibhajyavādins were strongly represented in south India, where they called themselves Theriyas. They survived until the seventeenth century in south India, and in Sri Lanka they became the Theravadins.\n\nThe Vibhajyavādins rejected the Sarvāstivāda claim that all dhammas (principles, phenomena) exist in the past, present and future. Instead, they made a distinction between dhammas that \"exist\" and dhammas that do not exist, hence the name \"distinctionists.\" The Vibhajyavādins held that dhammas exist in the present, but not that they exist in the future.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you explain functionalism and how it solves the problems of dualism and reductionism? \n\n<assistant> Functionalism is a philosophical position in the philosophy of mind that focuses on the function of mental states rather than their physical or non-physical nature. It proposes that what is important in understanding mental states is not the specific physical substrate that implements them, but rather their functional role within a broader system.\n\nDualism is a view that posits the existence of two distinct types of substances or properties: the mind and the body, or the mental and the physical. Dualism faces difficulties in explaining how these two fundamentally different types of things can causally interact with each other. Reductionism, on the other hand, is an approach that attempts to reduce complex phenomena to simpler, more fundamental components or properties. In the context of the philosophy of mind, reductionism often takes the form of type-identity theory, which states that mental states are identical to specific physical states in the brain.\n\nFunctionalism is designed to overcome limitations of both dualism and reductionism by focusing on the functional roles of mental states in a system rather than their specific physical or non-physical properties. Functionalism endorses the principle of multiple realizability, which means that the same mental state can be realized in different physical systems. For example, both a human and a computer can instantiate the same functional state, even though they are made of completely different material components.\n\nBy embracing this principle, functionalism is able to sidestep the problems faced by dualism and reductionism. It allows for the possibility that different physical systems can experience the same mental states, eliminating the anthropocentrism of type-identity theories. Furthermore, it avoids the causal interaction problem of dualism by positing that mental states are not distinct substances, but rather functional states that can be causally relevant within a physical system. \n\n<user> Jerry fodor's language of thought hypothesis? \n\n<assistant> Jerry fodor's language of thought (lot) hypothesis is a philosophical and cognitive science theory that proposes the existence of a mental language, sometimes called \"mentalese,\" in which thoughts are represented and manipulated. According to the lot hypothesis, our cognitive processes are structured like a language, with a well-defined syntax and an internalized set of rules that govern mental computation.\n\nThe lot hypothesis builds on the idea that thoughts are not merely unstructured associations, but rather are structured representations with an internal complexity that allows for mental manipulation and reasoning. When we think, our thoughts are processed and transformed in systematic ways, akin to the formal operations of a programming language or a natural language like english.\n\nOne key aspect of the lot hypothesis is its innateness claim. Fodor asserts that the basic elements of the language of thought and its rules of operation are innate, meaning that they are present in humans from birth and do not need to be learned explicitly. This view is supported by the universal presence of certain cognitive abilities across human cultures, such as the capacity to reason, plan, and solve problems.\n\nThe lot hypothesis has a number of implications for cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology. It provides a framework for understanding how complex cognitive processes can be carried out by the human brain, and suggests that our ability to think and reason is fundamentally linked to the structure and organization of our mental representations. It also lends support to the generative nature of human languages and posits that our capacity for language learning relies on an innate mental computational system.\n\nCritics of the lot hypothesis have raised various objections, such as potential infinite regresses in explaining how the lot itself is learned or the lack of necessity for explicit representation in propositional attitudes. However, fodor and other proponents of the hypothesis have responded to these concerns and continue to argue for the existence and importance of a language of thought. \n\n<user> Would you explain the major criticisms of fodor's lot hypothesis and his responses? \n\n<assistant> Fodor's language of thought (lot) hypothesis has faced several criticisms over the years, two of which are quite noteworthy: the risk of infinite regress and the challenge involving propositional attitudes.\n\nThe infinite regress objection, raised by simon blackburn in 1984, questions the necessity of a language of thought for explaining the learning of natural languages. Blackburn suggests that if learning natural languages requires the formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the lot, then the lot itself might also be seen as a language that needs to be learned through another, more fundamental, representational substrate. This could lead to an infinite regress, with each level of representation requiring yet another level beneath it. Fodor responds to this criticism by arguing that the lot is unique in its innateness – it does not need to be learned through another language because it is an innate mental structure.\n\nAnother criticism comes from daniel dennett, who challenges the necessity of explicit representation in propositional attitudes. He cites the example of attributing propositional attitudes to computers during a chess game, such as \"it thinks that the queen should be moved to the left.\" although we attribute such attitudes to computers, and these attributions help us explain and predict the computer's behavior, it is widely accepted that the computer is not literally thinking or believing anything in a mental language like mentalese. Dennett suggests that if explicit representation is not required for explaining the propositional attitudes of computers, then it may not be necessary for human beings either.\n\nFodor's response to dennett's criticism involves emphasizing the differences between computers and humans. He argues that human thinking is not merely the execution of algorithms or brute-force processing, but rather involves genuinely semantic reasoning and mental operations. Fodor maintains that the lot provides a plausible model of how such mental operations are carried out by the human brain. It's essential to understand the complexity and the nature of human cognition, which distinguishes it from mere machines following predetermined algorithms.\n\nWhile these criticisms address some of the core aspects of the lot hypothesis, fodor and other proponents have continued to defend the existence of a language of thought and its various implications for our understanding of cognition, mental representations, and the nature of thinking itself. \n\n<user> What are the applications of the lot hypothesis in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science? \n\n<assistant> The language of thought (lot) hypothesis has had significant implications and applications in the fields of artificial intelligence (ai) and cognitive science.\n\nOne major application is the development of symbolic ai or classical ai, in which intelligent agents manipulate symbols and rules in a formal, rule-governed system. Lot's idea of mental computation and manipulation of structured representations serves as a foundation for building computational models that resemble human cognition. This has led to the development of various ai systems, such as expert systems, logical reasoning systems, and early natural language processing models.\n\nIn cognitive science, the lot hypothesis has influenced the development of theories on mental representation, problem-solving, planning, and reasoning processes in humans. It offers a comprehensive framework to study the inherently structured nature of the human mind and helps explain the generativity and systematicity of human thought.\n\nResearchers across various disciplines in cognitive science, including psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience, have drawn upon the language of thought hypothesis to develop models and theories of cognition. Their work has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of how the brain processes and represents information, leading to new insights into the nature of human intelligence and the potential for developing artificial systems that exhibit human-like cognitive abilities.

From the point of view of semantics , errors must be accidents : if in the extension of \" horse \" there are no cows , then it cannot be required for the meaning of \" horse \" that cows be called horses \n On the other hand , if \" horse \" did not mean that which it means , and if it were an error for horses , it would never be possible for a cow to be called \" horse \n \" Putting the two things together , it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying \" this is a horse \" presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly , but not vice versa \n If we put this in terms of the crude causal theory , the fact that cows cause one to say \" horse \" depends on the fact that horses cause one to say \" horse \" \n but the fact that horses cause one to say \" horse \" does not depend on the fact that cows cause one to say \" horse \" \n\n\n \" \n\n = = Functionalism = = \n\n During the 1960s , various philosophers such as Donald Davidson , Hilary Putnam , and Fodor tried to resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so-called \" folk psychology \" while adhering to a materialist vision of the world which did not violate the \" generality of physics \" \n Their proposal was , first of all , to reject the then-dominant theories in philosophy of mind : behaviorism and the type identity theory \n The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation between mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation , especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event / cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events / causes \n The type-identity theory , on the other hand , failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state \n Besides being deeply anthropocentric ( why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe \n ) , the identity-type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others \n Hence , the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species \n \n\n One can solve these problems , according to Fodor , with functionalism , a hypothesis which was designed to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism \n What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it \n The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental \n Under this view , for example , I and a computer can both instantiate ( \" realize \" ) the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff ( see graphic at right ) \n On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism \n \n\n = = Evolution = = \n\n Fodor has co-written a book with the biolinguist Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini called What Darwin Got Wrong ( 2010 ) which describes neo-Darwinists as being \" distressingly uncritical \" and says of Darwin 's theory of evolution that \" it overestimates the contribution the environment makes in shaping the phenotype of a species and correspondingly underestimates the effects of endogenous variables \n \" Evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne describes this book as \" a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection \" and \" as biologically uninformed as it is strident \n \" Moral philosopher and anti-scientism author Mary Midgley praises What Darwin Got Wrong as \" an overdue and valuable onslaught on neo-Darwinist simplicities \" \n The book also received positive review by mathematician and Intelligent Design Theorist William Dembski \n \n\n = = Criticism = = \n\n A wide variety of philosophers of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor 's ideas \n For example , the language of thought hypothesis has been accused of either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous \n Specifically , Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT , this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned \n If natural language learning requires some representational substrate ( the LOT ) in order for it to be learned , why shouldn 't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on , ad infinitum \n On the other hand , if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT , then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages \n In this case , the LOT would be superfluous \n Fodor , in response , argues that the LOT is unique in that it does not have to be learned via an antecedent language because it is innate \n \n\n In 1981 Daniel Dennett had formulated another argument against the LOT \n Dennett suggested that it would seem , on the basis of the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior , that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes \n During a game of chess with a computer program , we often attribute such attitudes to the computer , saying such things as \" It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left \" \n We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts \n Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude \" I believe I can kick this guy 's butt \" in Mentalese \n The same is obviously true , suggests Dennett , of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as \" desiring to breathe clear air \" in a stuffy environment \n",

The decision was made to focus on growth within arizona and california.\n\nBevmo! Offers a wide selection of alcoholic beverages, including over 3000 types of wines, 1500 types of spirits, and 1200 types of beers. The stores often host weekly beer and wine tastings for a nominal fee. Wilfred wong, the cellar master, assesses wines for bevmo! And provides scores on a 100-point system. He also runs a blog and helped establish their \"vineyard partners\" in-house label. \n\n<user> How did they overcome the challenges after their expansion attempt into nevada and florida failed, leading to financial difficulties? \n\n<assistant> After facing financial difficulties due to their rapid expansion into nevada and florida, bevmo! Closed those stores and focused on consolidating their business. Bannus hudson and executive vice president david richards redirected the company's growth strategy, concentrating on arizona and california. Moreover, they decided to keep store sizes more manageable, around 20,000 square feet. These strategic changes helped the company stabilize its financial position and continue expanding within the target states. By 2000, bevmo! Had become the second-largest alcoholic beverage retailer in the us, with annual sales of $130 million. \n\n<user> Sometimes people have concerns about the impact of large retail chains on local communities. were there any such concerns or disputes involving bevmo! and its expansion? if so, give me some examples and how it affected their growth. \n\n<assistant> Yes, bevmo!'s expansion faced some resistance from local communities concerned about the potential negative effects of having a large retail chain in their town.

Their concerns revolved around possible outcomes such as the decline of small businesses, increased traffic patterns, and the overall impact on the community's character.\n\nThese challenges and disputes can slow down or even halt expansion plans, as companies need to address the concerns of the communities they plan to enter. Bevmo! Had to take these concerns into account when deciding on future store locations and their overall expansion strategy. It's important for retail chains like bevmo! To maintain a balance between growth and being sensitive to the concerns of local communities, ensuring that they contribute positively to the areas they serve. \n\n<user> How does bevmo! maintain compliance with age requirements for selling alcohol, especially regarding entrance to their stores? \n\n<assistant> Bevmo! Takes age requirements seriously to ensure compliance with laws related to selling alcoholic beverages. To begin with, the majority of products in their stores are alcoholic, which means that individuals must be either over the age of 21 or accompanied by an adult over the age of 25 to enter the store. This policy helps prevent underage customers from accessing their products.\n\nAdditionally, bevmo!'s arizona stores accept various forms of unexpired identification, including ids from all us states, military ids, passports, and mexico and canada ids. This practice ensures that they verify the age of their customers accurately and consistently.\n\nFurthermore, bevmo! Hosts weekly beer and wine tastings in compliance with state laws. A nominal fee ensures that only legal-age consumers can participate in these events. By adopting these measures, bevmo! Demonstrates their commitment to adhering to the age requirements and maintaining responsible practices in selling alcoholic beverages. ",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I'm curious about the meadow viper. can you please tell me about its appearance, where it's found, and its conservation status? \n\n<assistant> The meadow viper (vipera ursinii) is a small venomous snake, averaging in total length, with females being larger than males. They have a thick body, narrow head, and rough appearance. The snout is not upturned and they have large scales on the top of their head. Their dorsal scales are prominently keeled and are usually present in 19 rows. Their color can be gray, tan, or yellowish with a dark undulating dorsal stripe edged with black.\n\nThe meadow viper is found in a range of countries, including southeastern france, eastern austria, hungary, central italy, serbia, montenegro, croatia, bosnia and herzegovina, north macedonia, albania, romania, northern bulgaria, greece, turkey, northwestern iran, armenia, azerbaijan, georgia, russia, and extending across kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, and eastern uzbekistan steppes to china (xinjiang).\n\nThe meadow viper has a vulnerable conservation status and is considered the most threatened snake in europe. It is at risk due to habitat destruction caused by changes in agricultural practices and climate change in mountain areas, as well as collection for the pet trade. Grazing, mowing, fire, agriculture, roads, constructions, leisure activities, afforestation, cynegetic species management, persecution, illegal collection, and littering are some of the human activities threatening this species. Vipera ursinii is listed on cites appendix i, prohibiting commercial international trade, and is a strictly protected species under the berne convention's appendix ii. \n\n<user> Do we know anything about the venom of the meadow viper? \n\n<assistant> Although detailed information about the meadow viper's venom is limited, being a viper, it possesses venomous capabilities. The venom is used primarily for subduing and digesting prey. The potential toxicity of the venom to humans can vary, but generally, the meadow viper is considered less dangerous when compared to other venomous vipers in europe, like v. Aspis or v. Berus. These species are larger and their venom can have more severe effects on humans.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to treat a bite from any venomous snake seriously and seek immediate medical attention. Even if the venom isn't particularly potent, complications can arise from individual reactions to the venom or potential infections following a bite. \n\n<user> Given their threatened status, what conservation efforts or solutions are being implemented to help protect the meadow viper population? do we have an estimate of how many meadow vipers are left in the wild? \n\n<assistant> Several conservation actions are being pursued to protect the meadow viper population. These efforts mainly involve addressing the threats that caused the decline in the first place. Some measures include:\n\n1. Habitat restoration and protection: securing the snake's habitat by creating and enforcing protected areas or nature reserves and implementing habitat management practices like controlled grazing or mowing.\n2. Monitoring and research: this involves studying the population and its distribution, tracking its trends, and identifying key factors affecting its survival. This knowledge guides conservation actions and policy decisions.\n3. Education and awareness: raising public awareness about the species and its conservation issues, both locally and internationally, is essential in generating support for their protection.\n4. Legislation and enforcement: strengthening existing laws to protect the meadow viper, enforcing these laws, and improving cooperation between countries on international protection efforts.\n\nAs for an exact number of meadow vipers left in the wild, it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate due to factors like the secretive nature of the species and the vast geographic range they inhabit. However, given their vulnerable status on the iucn red list of threatened species, it is evident that their population has significantly declined, and continued efforts are needed to protect and conserve the species.

        "reference": "Common names: meadow viper, Ursini's viper, meadow adder, (more).\n\nVipera ursinii is a venomous viper and a very rare species, that is in danger of extinction. This species is commonly called the meadow viper. It is found in France, Italy, and Greece as well as much of eastern Europe. Several subspecies are recognized. Beyond the highly threatened European population, poorly known populations exist as far to the east as Kazakhstan and northwestern China.\n\nEtymology\nThe specific name or epithet, ursinii, is in honor of Italian naturalist Antonio Orsini (1788–1870).\n\nDescription\nAdults average  in total length, although specimens of  have been reported. Females are larger than males. Although sometimes confused with V. aspis or V. berus, it differs from them in the following characters. The smallest viper in Europe, its body is thick, its head narrow, and its appearance rough. The snout is not upturned. There are always several large scales or plates on the top of the head. The prominently keeled dorsal scales are in only 19 rows, and often dark skin shows between them. It is gray, tan, or yellowish with a dark undulating dorsal stripe, which is edged with black.\n\nCommon names\nMeadow viper, Ursini's viper, meadow adder, Orsini's viper, field viper, field adder. Although the following subspecies are currently invalid according to the taxonomy used here, their common names may still be encountered:\n\n V. u. ursinii – Italian meadow viper.\n V. u. macrops – karst viper, karst adder.\n V. u. rakosiensis – Danubian meadow viper.\n V. renardi – steppe viper, steppe adder, Renard's viper.\n V. u. moldavica – Moldavian meadow viper.\n\nGeographic range\nSoutheastern France, eastern Austria (extinct), Hungary, central Italy, Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, northern and northeastern Republic of Kosovo, North Macedonia, Albania, Romania, northern Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, northwestern Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia and across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and eastern Uzbekistan steppes to China (Xinjiang).\n\nVipera ursinii rakosiensis is native to Hungary although the taxonomic status of this subspecies is disputed (see section \"Taxonomy\")\n\nThe type locality is \" ...monti dell'Abruzzo prossimi alla provincia d'Ascoli... \" (...mountains of Abruzzo near the  Province of Ascoli Piceno, Italy...).\n\nConservation status\nThis species is considered to be a Vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, due to habitat destruction caused by changes in agricultural practices and climate change in mountain areas, and to collection for the pet trade.\n\nIn addition, this species is listed on CITES Appendix I, which prohibits commercial international trade, and is a strictly protected species (Appendix II) under the Berne Convention.\n\nVipera ursinii is the most threatened snake in Europe. At least 12 human activities are threatening these animals:\n1. Grazing \n2. Mowing\n3. Fire\n4. Agriculture\n5. Roads\n6. Constructions\n7. Leisure Activities\n8. Afforestation \n9. Cynegetic species management\n10. Persecution\n11. Illegal collection\n12. Littering\n\nTaxonomy\nThere is high genetic diversity within samples of Vipera ursinii and several species may be involved. At least six subspecies may be encountered in modern literature:\n\n Vipera ursinii ursinii (Bonaparte, 1835)\n Vipera ursinii eriwanensis (A.F. Reuss, 1933)\n Vipera ursinii graeca Nilson & Andrén, 1988\n Vipera ursinii macrops Méhelÿ, 1911\n Vipera ursinii moldavica Nilson, Andrén & Joger, 1993\n Vipera ursinii rakosiensis Méhely, 1893\n Vipera ursinii renardi Christoph, 1861\n\nGolay et al. (1993) recognize the first four, while Mallow et al. (2003) recognize five and list V. eriwanensis and V. renardi as valid species. However, McDiarmid et al. (1999), and thus ITIS, feel that more definitive data is necessary before any subspecies can be recognized.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nGolay P, Smith HM, Broadley DG, Dixon JR, McCarthy CJ, Rage J-C, Schätti B, Toriba M (1993).

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> History of washington state route 530. \n\n<assistant> Washington state route 530 (sr 530) is a state highway located in snohomish and skagit counties in washington. The first segment of sr 530 to appear on a map was a road extending from arlington to oso in 1899. The first segment that became state-maintained was secondary state highway 1e (ssh 1e), which ran from conway to arlington.\n\nSsh 1e was extended to darrington in 1957 and later renumbered as sr 530 in 1964. The road was further extended to reach rockport in 1983. However, the route from conway to i-5 was removed from the system in 1991. Since that time, minor construction projects arranged by the washington state department of transportation (wsdot) have improved the roadway, and wsdot plans to realign the highway near the sauk river.\n\nSr 530 currently runs northeast for about 52 miles (81.30 km) from an interchange with interstate 5 (i-5) southwest of arlington, passing sr 9 in arlington and darrington, and ending at sr 20 in rockport. The roadway serves several communities, including arlington, arlington heights, oso, darrington, and rockport. The route travels parallel to a fork of the stillaguamish river from arlington to darrington, the sauk river from darrington to rockport, and a bnsf railway route that extends from arlington to cicero, located west of oso. \n\n<user> Can you provide more information about the former route of sr 530 from 1964 to 1991? \n\n<assistant> From 1964 until 1991, Washington State Route 530 (SR 530) had a different alignment than it does today. During that period, it began at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) in Conway and traveled southeast to I-5 again at the current western terminus, then followed its current route. The former routing, now called the Pioneer Highway, followed the Seattle-Vancouver, BC route of the Great Northern Railway served by the International train from Conway to Silvana.\n\nThe former route of SR 530 started at a diamond interchange with I-5 in Conway, which also marked the western terminus of SR 534. From the interchange, the roadway traveled west to Fir Island Road, which goes west across the South Fork of the Skagit River to reach Fir Island. The road then turned south to parallel railroad tracks owned by the Great Northern Railway, and it also ran parallel to the South Fork of the Skagit River.\n\nAt Milltown, SR 530 intersected with Milltown Road, which later had an interchange with I-5 to the east. The route followed a more southerly path than the current alignment until it reached the existing western terminus with I-5, from where it proceeded following its current route. This former routing provided a connection between Conway, Silvana, and other communities along the Pioneer Highway.\n\nIn 1991, the route was changed to remove the section from Conway to I-5 from the system. The current alignment of SR 530 starts at a diamond interchange with I-5 southwest of Arlington and goes on to serve Arlington, Arlington Heights, Oso, Darrington, and Rockport, ending at SR 20 in Rockport. The former route is still accessible via local roads, including the Pioneer Highway, which parallels the route that SR 530 took during its 1964-1991 alignment. \n\n<user> What significant changes or construction projects have occurred since 1991? \n\n<assistant> Since 1991, washington state route 530 (sr 530) has experienced some changes and improvements. The washington state department of transportation (wsdot) has arranged for several minor construction projects, focusing on enhancing the roadway's safety and efficiency.\n\nSome of these construction works include bridge replacements, adding turn lanes, installing traffic signals at major intersections, and repaving portions of the roadway. These projects have been aimed at improving the driving experience for motorists, reducing congestion, and minimizing the risk of accidents.\n\nOne significant change since 1991 was the removal of the section of sr 530 from conway to interstate 5 (i-5) from the state highway system, which shortened the length of the route. This realignment shifted the western terminus of sr 530 to its current location at a diamond interchange with i-5 southwest of arlington.\n\nWsdot also has plans to realign the highway near the sauk river. This realignment project aims to improve the route's safety and to address any issues that may arise due to the river's natural dynamics, such as erosion or flooding. Through this realignment, wsdot aims to provide a more stable and durable roadway, ensuring the uninterrupted operation of the highway.\n\nAnother aspect of improvement has been the growth in traffic. In 2007, the daily average number of motorists using the stretch of road after the i-5 interchange was 22,000, which is considerably higher than the 5,400 daily motorist count in 1970. This increase in traffic indicates the importance of continued maintenance and improvements to ensure the safe flow of traffic along sr 530.\n\nIn summary, since 1991, sr 530 has seen minor construction projects aimed at enhancing its safety and efficiency, the removal of its conway to i-5 segment, and a significant increase in daily traffic. Wsdot continues to plan and execute further improvements, including realigning portions of the highway, to address current and future needs. ",

The ohio bicentennial was a series of events and programs held in the u.s. State of ohio to celebrate the 200th anniversary of its statehood on march 1, 2003. The ohio bicentennial commission was established by the ohio general assembly in 1995 to sponsor commemorative barn paintings, bells, and historical markers throughout the state in the years leading up to the celebration. Other state and federal agencies also marked the anniversary with special events and designations.\n\nOne notable commemoration was the barn painting program. From 1997 to september 2002, scott hagan of belmont county painted a barn in each of ohio's 88 counties with the committee's logo and colors. Nearly 2,000 barn owners volunteered their barns to be painted, and a total of 101 barns were painted freehand. Unfortunately, by 2013, many of the painted barns had faded or been repainted or torn down. Scott hagan went on to paint barn advertisements across the country after that.\n\nAnother unique celebration was the verdin company casting a bronze bell on site, out in the open, in each county throughout the bicentennial year. The process for casting each bell took two days using a mobile foundry.\n\nDuring the summer of 2003, there was also a wagon train that traveled across the state on the historic national road from martins ferry to the indiana state line at new paris.\n\nIn addition to these events, the ohio bureau of motor vehicles issued a radical redesign of the state's license plate, with a design that bore the commission's logo, the words \"1803 ohio bicentennial 2003,\" and a new six-digit numbering scheme.\n\nThere were other commemorations as well, including a u.s.

Each barn cost around $1,500 to paint, which was $500 less than the rent for a billboard. By having a painted barn in each county, it encouraged residents and visitors to travel the state and experience ohio's diverse rural landscape while commemorating the state's historic milestone. Not only did it raise awareness of the bicentennial, but it also showcased ohio's proud agricultural heritage and the importance of barns in rural communities. \n\n<user> That's interesting! it seems like a creative and unique way to celebrate such an occasion. i'm curious about the bronze bells cast in each county. how were they made using a mobile foundry, and what was the significance of these bells? \n\n<assistant> The ohio bicentennial commission commissioned the verdin company of cincinnati to cast a bronze bell in each of the 88 ohio counties during the bicentennial year. The company used a mobile foundry to create the bells on-site, out in the open, providing a unique and educational experience for the public.\n\nThe mobile foundry was a portable furnace and casting system that allowed the verdin company to transport the necessary equipment to each location. The process of casting a bell took two days. First, the furnace heated the bronze to approximately 2,200 degrees fahrenheit, at which point it became molten. Then, the molten bronze was carefully poured into a mold to form the bell. Upon cooling and solidification, the bell was removed from the mold, cleaned, and polished.\n\nThe significance of these bells was manifold. They served as a symbol of unity, representing each county's participation in the state's bicentennial celebration. Additionally, the bells showcased ohio's rich history of metalworking and craftsmanship. They also created lasting landmarks in each county, honoring the state's 200 years of progress and heritage. \n\n<user> Sounds like a fantastic celebration! are there any resources or links to find more about ohio bicentennial or see the photographs of those barns? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are resources where you can find more information and photographs of the ohio bicentennial and its related events.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I've heard about foreign exchange swaps and i'm wondering how they work and what their uses are. can you provide more details on this topic? \n\n<assistant> A foreign exchange swap, also known as a forex swap or fx swap, is a financial instrument that involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of identical amounts of one currency for another with two different value dates. This structure helps manage funds in different currencies efficiently and without acquiring foreign exchange risk.\n\nAn fx swap has two legs: a spot transaction and a forward transaction. These are executed simultaneously for the same quantity and offset each other. The spot transaction is typically agreed upon within the same week, while the forward transaction is based on a future date. A forward-forward transaction is also possible, where neither leg is a spot transaction.\n\nThe most common use of foreign exchange swaps is for institutions to fund their foreign exchange balances. Once a foreign exchange transaction settles, the holder is left with a positive (or \"long\") position in one currency and a negative (or \"short\") position in another. Institutions close out any foreign balances and re-institute them for the following day using \"tom-next\" swaps. The interest collected or paid every night is known as the cost of carry, and specific trades based on this are referred to as carry trades.\n\nCompanies may also use foreign exchange swaps to avoid foreign exchange risk. For example, a british company with sales in europe and expenses in britain may create a 1-month swap to manage the currencies efficiently while avoiding fx risk. They would sell eur and buy gbp on spot while simultaneously buying eur and selling gbp on a 1-month forward.\n\nPricing of fx swaps is based on the relationship between spot and forward rates, known as interest rate parity. The forward points, or swap points, are quoted as the difference between forward and spot rates and are approximately proportional to the interest rate differential.\n\nForeign exchange swaps should not be confused with currency swaps, which are rarer long-term transactions governed by different rules. \n\n<user> I'm interested in the example you mentioned about the british company. can you walk me through each step of the swap and explain how it helps them manage currencies and reduce risk? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Let's break down the steps of the foreign exchange swap for the british company:\n\n1. The british company has sales in europe, so they receive payments in eur. However, their primary operations are in britain, and they need gbp to cover expenses.\n\n2. The company knows that they will need to pay their manufacturers in europe in 1 month. One option would be to spot sell their eur and buy gbp to cover their expenses in britain now, and then spot buy eur and sell gbp to pay their business partners in europe in 1 month. But this exposes them to foreign exchange risk, as the eur/gbp exchange rate could move against them.\n\n3. To reduce this risk, the company decides to create a 1-month foreign exchange swap. In the first leg of the swap, they sell eur and buy gbp on the spot market. This allows them to cover their immediate expenses in britain.\n\n4. Simultaneously, in the second leg of the swap, they agree to buy eur and sell gbp on a 1-month forward contract. This ensures that they will have the necessary amount of eur to pay their european partners in 1 month, regardless of any fluctuations in the eur/gbp exchange rate.\n\nThrough this foreign exchange swap, the british company can manage their currencies more efficiently and protect themselves from potential losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n<user> That was a helpful walkthrough, thank you. i also noticed you mentioned \"tom-next\" swaps in your initial explanation. could you elaborate on how these swaps work and why institutions use them to manage their foreign exchange balances? \n\n<assistant> Tom-next swaps are a specific type of foreign exchange swap used by institutions to manage their foreign exchange balances on a daily basis. Tom-next stands for \"tomorrow-next day,\" referring to the short-term nature of these swaps.\n\nHere's how tom-next swaps work:\n\n1. At the end of every day, institutions with foreign exchange balances need to close out any foreign balances.\n\n2. To do this, they use tom-next swaps, buying (or selling) a foreign amount settling tomorrow and then doing the opposite, selling (or buying) it back settling the day after.\n\n3. The purpose of this swap is to collect or pay any overnight interest due on the foreign balances, which is known as the cost of carry.\n\nInstitutions use tom-next swaps to manage their foreign exchange balances because these swaps allow them to temporarily close out their currency positions overnight without exposing them to significant foreign exchange risk. The short-term nature of tom-next swaps makes them an efficient tool for daily management of currency positions, allowing institutions to collect or pay overnight interest as needed, and facilitating carry trades, which are based on expected daily interest gains or costs.

        "reference": "In finance, a foreign exchange swap, forex swap, or FX swap is a simultaneous purchase and sale of identical amounts of one currency for another with two different value dates (normally spot to forward) and may use foreign exchange derivatives. An FX swap allows sums of a certain currency to be used to fund charges designated in another currency without acquiring foreign exchange risk. It permits companies that have funds in different currencies to manage them efficiently.\n\nStructure\nA foreign exchange swap has two legs - a spot transaction and a forward transaction - that are executed simultaneously for the same quantity, and therefore offset each other. Forward foreign exchange transactions occur if both companies have a currency the other needs. It prevents negative foreign exchange risk for either party. Foreign exchange spot transactions are similar to forward foreign exchange transactions in terms of how they are agreed upon; however, they are planned for a specific date in the very near future, usually within the same week.\n\nIt is also common to trade \"forward-forward\" transactions, where the first leg is not a spot transaction, but already a forward date.\n\nUses\n\nThe most common  use of foreign exchange swaps is for institutions to fund their foreign exchange balances.\n\nOnce a foreign exchange transaction settles, the holder is left with a positive (or \"long\") position in one currency and a negative (or \"short\") position in another. In order to collect or pay any overnight interest due on these foreign balances, at the end of every day institutions will close out any foreign balances and re-institute them for the following day.

As currency traders know roughly how much holding a currency position will make or cost on a daily basis, specific trades are put on based on this; these are referred to as carry trades.\n\nCompanies may also use them to avoid foreign exchange risk.\n\nExample:\n\nA British Company may be long EUR from sales in Europe but operate primarily in Britain using GBP. However, they know that they need to pay their manufacturers in Europe in 1 month.\n\nThey could spot sell their EUR and buy GBP to cover their expenses in Britain, and then in one month spot buy EUR and sell GBP to pay their business partners in Europe.\n\nHowever, this exposes them to FX risk. If Britain has financial trouble and the EUR/GBP exchange rate moves against them, they may have to spend a lot more GBP to get the same amount of EUR.\n\nTherefore they create a 1 month swap, where they Sell EUR and Buy GBP on spot and simultaneously buy EUR and sell GBP on a 1 month (1M) forward. This significantly reduces their risk. The company knows they will be able to purchase EUR reliably while still being able to use currency for domestic transactions in the interim.\n\nPricing\n\nThe relationship between spot and forward is known as the interest rate parity, which states that\n\nwhere\n F = forward rate\n S = spot rate\n rd = simple interest rate of the term currency\n rf = simple interest rate of the base currency\n T = tenor (calculated according to the appropriate day count convention)\n\nThe forward points or swap points are quoted as the difference between forward and spot, F - S, and is expressed as the following:\n\nif  is small. Thus, the value of the swap points is roughly proportional to the interest rate differential.\n\nRelated instruments\nA foreign exchange swap should not be confused with a currency swap, which is a rarer long-term transaction governed by different rules.\n\nSee also\n Cross currency swap\n Foreign exchange market\n Forward exchange rate\n Interest rate parity\n Overnight indexed swap\n\nReferences\n\nSwaps (finance)\nForeign exchange market\nInterest rates",

The sncf tgv sud-est was built by alstom and francorail-mte, and operated by sncf, the french national railway company. A total of 111 trainsets were produced between 1978 and 1988. Each trainset consisted of two power cars (locomotives) and eight articulated passenger carriages. In the case of the tri-voltage trainsets, there were ten carriages.\n\nThe power cars had a power output of 6,450 kw under 25 kv. Each trainset had a powered bogie in each of the carriages adjacent to the power cars. The trainsets were 200 meters long and 2.81 meters wide, weighing 385 metric tons.\n\nOriginally, the tgv sud-est trainsets were designed to run at a speed of 260 km/h. However, most of the trainsets underwent a mid-life refurbishment, upgrading their speed to 300 km/h in preparation for the opening of the lgv méditerranée. Some sets still maintained a maximum speed of 260 km/h, mainly used on routes with a comparatively short distance on high-speed lines.\n\nRegarding the livery, they initially used a distinctive orange, grey, and white combination. Later, they switched to a silver livery akin to the tgv atlantique sets, and eventually adopted the sncf carmillon livery starting in 2012. \n\n<user> What about the tgv la poste trains? how were they different? \n\n<assistant> The tgv la poste trains were special versions of the tgv sud-est trainsets. Instead of carrying passengers, they were designed to transport mail for the french postal service, la poste. These trains had a different look, painted in the striking yellow la poste livery.\n\nThere were initially five bi-current half-sets made for carrying mail, which later increased to seven. These half-sets didn't have any seats because their purpose was solely for mail transportation. They operated between paris, lyon, and avignon.\n\nSo, the main differences between the tgv la poste trains and the regular tgv sud-est trainsets were their distinct yellow livery and the fact that they were designed to transport mail, not passengers. \n\n<user> In terms of real-life application, how does one distinguish the tgv sud-est trains from other tgv trains like the tgv-atlantique and tgv-réseau versions? do the trainsets have any unique features? \n\n<assistant> There are some distinguishing features that set the tgv sud-est trainsets apart from the tgv-atlantique and tgv-réseau versions. One noticeable difference is a break in the roof located just above the cabin windows for tgv sud-est trainsets. This feature helps identify them from the other versions.\n\nOther distinctions come down to the liveries used throughout their service history. The original orange, grey, and white livery was unique only to the tgv sud-est trainsets at the time. The silver livery and sncf carmillon livery came later, but they also resemble those found on the tgv atlantique sets.\n\nTo differentiate them in real-life application, observing the break in the roof just above the cabin windows would be the most reliable method. \n\n<user> Can you share some details related to the retirement of the tgv sud-est trainsets and the farewell service? \n\n<assistant> The tgv sud-est trainsets served for many years before eventually being retired. In december 2019, all tgv sud-est sets were withdrawn from service. In early 2020, a special farewell service was organized which included the tgv01, the very first tgv train ever built. This particular train was nicknamed \"patrick.\"\n\nDuring its farewell service, tgv01 was painted in all three liveries that it used throughout its years of operation, allowing passengers to experience the full history of the train.

A total of 111 trainsets were built between 1978 and 1988 for the first TGV service in France between Paris and Lyon which opened in 1981. The trainsets were semi-permanently coupled, consisting of two power cars (locomotives) and eight articulated passenger carriages, ten in the case of the tri-voltage sets. The trains were named after the Ligne à Grande Vitesse Sud-Est () that they first operated on. They were also referred to as TGV-PSE, an abbreviation of Paris Sud-Est.\n\nHistory\n\nThe TGV Sud-Est fleet was built between 1978 and 1988 and operated the first TGV service from Paris to Lyon in 1981. Formerly there were 107 passenger sets operating, of which nine were tri-current (25 kV 50-60 Hz AC - French lignes à grande vitesse, 1500 V DC - French lignes classiques, 15 kV 16⅔ Hz AC - Switzerland) and the rest bi-current (25 kV 50–60 Hz AC, 1500 V DC). There were also five, later seven, bi-current half-sets - TGV La Poste - without seats which carried mail for La Poste between Paris, Lyon and Avignon. These were painted in the distinctive La Poste yellow livery.\n\nEach set was made up of two power cars and eight carriages (capacity 345 seats), including a powered bogie in each of the carriages adjacent to the power cars. They were  long and  wide. They weighed  with a power output of  under 25 kV.\n\nWhen the trains were delivered they wore a distinctive orange, grey, and white livery. The last set to wear this livery was repainted in the silver livery similar to the TGV Atlantique sets in 2001. From 2012 trains were repainted in the new SNCF Carmillon livery. The TGV Sud-Est sets can be easily distinguished from the TGV-Atlantique and TGV-Reseau versions by the break in the roof just above the cabin windows.\n\nOriginally the sets were built to run at  but most were upgraded to  during their mid-life refurbishment in preparation for the opening of the LGV Méditerranée. The few sets which still have a maximum speed of  operate on routes which have a comparatively short distance on the lignes à grande vitesse, such as those to Switzerland via Dijon. SNCF did not consider it financially worthwhile to upgrade their speed for a marginal reduction in journey time.\n\nNine sets were originally delivered as all first class. Set 88 was used as a test train for synchronous traction motors then subsequently rebuilt as a tri-voltage set and renumbered 118. Set 114 was sold to SBB in 1993 and a second set in 2005. In 1995, Set 38, one of the all first class sets, was converted to an extra postal set in addition to the existing 5 half-sets.\n\nIn March 2012, a hired postal set, numbered 951, was taken to London to advertise the Euro Carex project.\n\nIn February 2013 the TGV Lyria sets (110 to 118), designed for services to Switzerland, were taken out of service. These were replaced by TGV POS sets.\n\nIn December 2019, all TGV Sud-Est sets were retired from service. In early 2020, a farewell service was run which included TGV01 (nicknamed Patrick), the very first TGV train ever built. This train was painted in all 3 liveries that it used during its service.\n\nIn service\n\nThe TGV Sud-Est sets were originally used on services between Paris, Lyon, Marseille and other cities in the south-east of France. In 2013 there were still 55 sets in use on services to south-eastern France and on cross-country services. The remaining sets were replaced by TGV POS in late 2019.\n\nFleet List\n\nNumbering\nThe power cars were numbered as Class 23000 dual voltage locomotives, with the trailers being numbered according to the position in the set they were allocated to. So for Set XXX they would be numbered 123XXX, 223XXX, 323XXX and so on. The triple-voltage sets were numbered similarly but as Class 33000. Postal half sets were initially numbered P1–P5, later to P7. The power cars were numbered 923001—005, similarly the intermediate vehicles added a 9 in front of number.\n\nNames\nMany of the sets received names, principally of French communes, towns and cities.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you give me a summary of voltaire's candide? \n\n<assistant> Candide, or optimism, is a french satire written by voltaire, a philosopher of the age of enlightenment. First published in 1759, the story follows a young man named candide, who is living a sheltered life in an edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with leibnizian optimism by his mentor, professor pangloss. The novella begins with the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, and candide then endures a series of hardships, slowly leading to his disillusionment with the optimistic philosophy.\n\nCandide is known for its sarcastic tone, fantastical and fast-moving plot, and allegorical critique of religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers. Voltaire particularly targets leibniz and his optimism, highlighting the flaws of believing that \"all is for the best\" in the \"best of all possible worlds.\"\n\nThe story is influenced by historical events such as the seven years' war and the 1755 lisbon earthquake, which challenged the optimistic worldview held by many philosophers at the time. Candide ultimately advocates a deeply practical precept, \"we must cultivate our garden,\" as an alternative to the mantra of optimism. Today, candide is considered voltaire's magnum opus and is frequently taught in literature classes. \n\n<user> How did the 1755 lisbon earthquake influence candide? \n\n<assistant> The 1755 lisbon earthquake, which occurred on all saints' day, was a catastrophic event that shook the foundations of contemporary theology and philosophy, particularly the optimistic doctrine of the time. This optimism, based on the theodicy of gottfried wilhelm leibniz, posited that everything happens for the best in this world because god is benevolent. This belief can be summarized as \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.\"\n\nThe earthquake, along with the resulting tsunami and fires, caused massive destruction and loss of life. This catastrophe presented a challenge for philosophers who tried to reconcile such a devastating event with the optimistic worldview. Voltaire, who was already disillusioned with such idealist doctrines, used the earthquake as an opportunity to satirize and criticize optimism in candide.\n\nIn both candide and his \"poem on the lisbon disaster,\" voltaire disputes the notion of an optimist world by incorporating elements from the lisbon earthquake. He employs sarcasm to ridicule the idea that the earthquake could be considered a part of the \"best possible world,\" highlighting the absurdity of the optimist perspective when confronted with real-world suffering and catastrophe.\n\nVoltaire also drew on contemporary sources like ange goudar's \"relation historique du tremblement de terre survenu à lisbonne\" for information on the earthquake, using facts and details to emphasize the magnitude of the disaster and the urgency of reevaluating optimistic philosophy in light of such events. \n\n<user> How does the satirical tone of candide impact readers' view of the story? \n\n<assistant> The satirical tone of candide is an essential aspect of the novella, as it delivers a powerful critique of the various targets of voltaire's criticism—religious orthodoxy, governments, philosophies, and, most notably, leibnizian optimism. By employing satire, voltaire is able to accentuate the absurdity of certain ideas and beliefs, ultimately inviting readers to reconsider their own viewpoints.\n\nThrough the humor and wit of satire, voltaire engages readers by depicting serious issues in a more accessible manner. As readers follow the fantastical and fast-moving plot, they are confronted with various absurd situations that reveal the inherent contradictions, hypocrisy, or illogic of the various targets of his satire. This enables readers to discern issues that might not have been as apparent in a more straightforward narrative.\n\nA prime example of this satirical tone is the portrayal of pangloss, candide's mentor, who embodies the extremist version of optimism. Pangloss insists, against all visible evidence, that everything happens for the best, even when confronted by extreme suffering and hardship. His dogmatic adherence to optimism is portrayed in a comical and absurd way, ultimately highlighting the flaws of the overly idealistic philosophy and the problems caused by blind faith in such a system.\n\nAdditionally, voltaire utilizes caricatures, exaggerations, and even elements of farce throughout the story, which create a lighter and more entertaining atmosphere despite the grave subject matter, making it more digestible for a wider audience. However, this does not imply that the work aims simply to amuse; rather, the humor, combined with voltaire's keen insights into human nature and society, serve as a vehicle for the deeper message, which calls for a more practical, grounded approach to living in the world.\n\nBy utilizing satire, voltaire encourages readers to think critically about the philosophical systems and societal institutions they encounter, and to look beyond dogmas and assumptions in favor of reason, practicality, and compassion. In doing so, candide not only entertains but also educates, ultimately promoting the enlightenment values of rationality, skepticism, and the pursuit of truth as a means of improving the human condition. \n\n<user> How has candide influenced later authors and artists? \n\n<assistant> Candide has had a lasting impact on subsequent authors and artists, who have been inspired by its sharp wit, insightful portrayal of the human condition, and its bold critique of prevailing societal norms and philosophical doctrines. The innovative use of satire, combined with the fantastical plot and memorable characters, has influenced countless works of fiction, as well as adaptations in various art forms.\n\nAuthors such as jonathan swift, who also employed satire in works like gulliver's travels, are seen as precursors to candide. In turn, candide has inspired later authors in the tradition of satirical literature, urging them to address serious social and political issues through humor and wit. The novella has also been a foundation for picaresque and bildungsroman genres, with authors using it as a blueprint for crafting their own stories of the protagonist's mishaps and journey towards enlightenment and self-discovery.\n\nCandide's influence extends beyond literature, as it has been adapted into numerous operas, plays, and ballets, an example being leonard bernstein's operetta \"candide.\" furthermore, the novella's central themes and ideas have resonated through various art forms, with creators drawing inspiration from voltaire's critique of blind optimism and the need for practical engagement with the world around us. In this way, candide's legacy continues to thrive in both literature and the broader realm of arts and culture. ",

Professor Pangloss \n The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle , followed by Candide 's slow , painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world \n Voltaire concludes with Candide , if not rejecting optimism outright , advocating a deeply practical precept , \" we must cultivate our garden \" , in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss , \" all is for the best \" in the \" best of all possible worlds \" \n \n\n Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone as well as by its erratic , fantastical and fast-moving plot \n A picaresque novel with a story similar to that of a more serious Bildungsroman , it parodies many adventure and romance clichés , the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact \n Still , the events discussed are often based on historical happenings , such as the Seven Years ' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake \n As philosophers of Voltaire 's day contended with the problem of evil , so too does Candide in this short novel , albeit more directly and humorously \n Voltaire ridicules religion , theologians , governments , armies , philosophies , and philosophers through allegory \n most conspicuously , he assaults Leibniz and his optimism \n \n\n As expected by Voltaire , Candide has enjoyed both great success and great scandal \n Immediately after its secretive publication , the book was widely banned because it contained religious blasphemy , political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of naïveté \n However , with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition , the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it \n Today , Candide is recognized as Voltaire 's magnum opus and is often listed as part of the Western canon \n it is among the most frequently taught works of French literature \n The British poet and literary critic Martin Seymour-Smith listed Candide as one of the 100 most influential books ever written \n \n\n = = Historical and literary background = = \n\n A number of historical events inspired Voltaire to write Candide , most notably the publication of Leibniz 's \" Monadology \" , a short metaphysical treatise , the Seven Years ' War , and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake \n Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in Candide and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition \n The 1755 Lisbon earthquake , tsunami , and resulting fires of All Saints ' Day , had a strong influence on theologians of the day and on Voltaire , who was himself disillusioned by them \n The earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism , a philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur \n Optimism is founded on the theodicy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz that says all is for the best because God is a benevolent deity \n This concept is often put into the form , \" all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds \" ( Fr \n Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles ) \n Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into the optimist world view \n \n\n Voltaire actively rejected Leibnizian optimism after the natural disaster , convinced that if this were the best possible world , it should surely be better than it is \n In both Candide and Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ( \" Poem on the Lisbon Disaster \" ) , Voltaire attacks this optimist belief \n He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both Candide and his Poème to argue this point , sarcastically describing the catastrophe as one of the most horrible disasters \" in the best of all possible worlds \" \n Immediately after the earthquake , unreliable rumours circulated around Europe , sometimes overestimating the severity of the event \n Ira Wade , a noted expert on Voltaire and Candide , has analysed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event \n Wade speculates that Voltaire 's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu à Lisbonne by Ange Goudar \n \n\n Apart from such events , contemporaneous stereotypes of the German personality may have been a source of inspiration for the text , as they were for Simplicius Simplicissimus , a 1669 satirical picaresque novel written by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen and inspired by the Thirty Years ' War \n The protagonist of this novel , who was supposed to embody stereotypically German characteristics , is quite similar to the protagonist of Candide \n These stereotypes , according to Voltaire biographer Alfred Owen Aldridge , include \" extreme credulousness or sentimental simplicity \" , two of Candide 's , and Simplicius 's , defining qualities \n Aldridge writes , \" Since Voltaire admitted familiarity with fifteenth-century German authors who used a bold and buffoonish style , it is quite possible that he knew Simplicissimus as well \n \" \n\n A satirical and parodic precursor of Candide , Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels ( 1726 ) is one of Candide 's closest literary relatives \n",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Unique hands and scores in cribbage? i'm looking for a general overview of probabilities and maximums. \n\n<assistant> Certainly! In cribbage, there are 12,994,800 possible hands, considering both the held cards and the starter card. Each hand has various unique combinations, and not accounting for suit, there are 14,715 unique hands. The probabilities and maximum scores can be computed based on this.\n\nAbout 1,009,008 (or 7.8%) of these hands score zero points. For the crib, the number increases to 1,022,208, as the starter must be the same suit as the crib's four cards. This is taken into consideration while calculating the probabilities.\n\nSome notable maximum scores in cribbage are:\n- the highest score for one hand is 29 points, which occurs when holding 555j with a starter 5 of the same suit as the jack.\n- the second highest score is 28 points and can happen if the hand and starter together have any ten-point card plus all four 5s, except for the 29-point hand.\n- the third highest score is 24 points and can occur in multiple card combinations, such as a7777, 33339, 36666, 44447, and others.\n\nIn terms of pegging and dealer scores, the maximum number of points that can be pegged by playing one card is 15 points. The highest score a dealer can get from the hand and crib in a two-player game is 53 points, and the highest score possible in one round, excluding pegging points, is 77 points.\n\nAlthough these scores represent maximum possibilities, they may not always occur due to strategic gameplay and card distribution. \n\n<user> Can you describe situations when these maximum scores occur or are possible? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Let's go through some specific examples for each maximum score described earlier:\n\n1. The 29-point hand: the hand consists of 555j, with the same suit jack as the starter 5. In this hand, you get 8 points for four j-5 combinations, 8 points for four 5-5-5 combinations, 12 points for pairs of 5s, and one point for \"his nob\" (the jack's suit matching the starter card's suit).\n\n2. The 28-point hand: this happens when you have four 5s and any ten-point card in your hand, except for the 29-point hand scenario. You'll get points from various 5-5 combinations, ten-point card and 5 combinations, and the 5s as a group.\n\n3. The 24-point hand: here are some of the combinations that score 24 points:\n- a7777: you get 12 points from triple runs of a-7 (4 combinations), plus you gain another 12 points for the four pairs of 7s. \n   - 33339: in this example, 3 triple runs of 3-3-3-9 each score 6 points (total of 18), and 3 pairs of 3s add 6 more points.\n   Other combinations mentioned earlier (36666, 44447, etc.) also follow similar patterns to achieve 24 points.\n\nRegarding the maximum pegging and dealer scores:\n\n4. The 15-point peg: two scenarios can result in this:\nA) non-dealer with two 10-value cards and two 2s, dealer with 10-value card and 722: play goes 10-10-10-go; 7-2-2-2-2.\n   B) both players with two deuces, one holding a-4, the other two aces: play might go 4-a-a-a-2-2-2-2.\n\n5. The 53-point dealer score: the starter must be a 5, the hand must be j555 (jack's suit matching the starter), and the crib must be 4466 (score 24), or vice versa.\n\nThese are some of the situations when maximum scores can occur. However, it's important to remember that ideal circumstances are rare and players' strategies can prevent these scenarios from happening. \n\n<user> Are these maximum scores something a player should attempt to achieve during a real game? how can understanding these maximums help improve one's gameplay? \n\n<assistant> While the maximum scores represent the highest possible points a hand can achieve, they are relatively rare and should not be the primary focus during gameplay. However, understanding these maximum scores can help players in the following ways:\n\n1. Recognizing potential high-scoring combinations: knowing these maximum scores helps players identify card combinations that may yield high points and make informed decisions while discarding cards or building their crib.\n\n2. Understanding probabilities: awareness of maximum scores and the likelihood of achieving them allows players to gauge their chances during play and make better decisions based on risk-reward factors.\n\n3. Developing a sound strategy: an understanding of maximum scores and their occurrences informs players of potential worst-case scenarios for their opponent and can help them plan defensive moves accordingly.\n\nIn summary, while players shouldn't necessarily base their entire gameplay on chasing maximum scores, understanding the various possibilities can enhance decision-making, risk assessment, and overall strategic planning. An effective gameplay should focus on optimizing hand values based on the dealt cards and strategic interactions with opponents. \n\n<user> That's helpful. could you give some examples of more practical and relatively achievable high-scoring hands that players might come across in an actual game? also, can you provide some general tips for cribbage strategy? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Here are some more practical and achievable high-scoring hands players might encounter in real games:\n\n1. 15-point hands: for example, holding 4-5-6-7 with the starter being any 5. These hands would have a run of 4, a pair, and 15-count combinations to score points.\n\n2. 12-point hands: an example is holding a 7-7-8-8 with a 7 as the starter card. Here, you have a double run of 3 and two pairs, which results in a 12-point hand.\n\nAs for general cribbage strategy tips, consider the following:\n\n1. Discard with caution: try to minimize the potential score that your opponent can gain from your discards. For example, avoid discarding combinations like 5-10, 5-k, or consecutive cards of the same suit that could create runs or high-point combinations.\n\n2. Aim for balanced hands: focus on forming hands with balanced point values that can potentially score from pairs, runs, and 15-count combinations. This reduces dependency on perfect starter cards or card combinations.\n\n3. Pay attention to pegging opportunities: be attentive during the play portion, as pegging can give you extra points. Look for opportunities to create runs, pairs, or reach the count of 15 while placing your cards.\n\n4. Adapt your strategy: always adjust your gameplay to your specific hand and the overall game situation. Sometimes a defensive play might be more effective than playing aggressively, even if it sacrifices some immediate points.\n\nBy incorporating these examples and tips into your gameplay, you can improve your cribbage strategy and enhance your chances of success in the game. Remember, consistent practice and learning from real-game experiences are key to mastering cribbage. ",

Therefore, the calculation becomes:\n\n 1,009,008 (approximately 7.8%) of these score zero points, or 1,022,208 if the hand is the crib, as the starter must be the same suit as the crib's four cards for a flush.\n Not accounting for suit, there are 14,715 unique hands.\n\nMaximum scores\n The highest score for one hand is 29: 555J in hand with the starter 5 of the same suit as the Jack (8 points for four J-5 combinations, 8 points for four 5-5-5 combinations, 12 points for pairs of 5s and one for his nob).\n The second highest score is 28 (hand and starter together comprise any ten-point card plus all four 5s, apart from the 29-point hand above). \n The third highest score is 24 (A7777, 33339, 36666, 44447, 44556, 44566, 45566, 67788 or 77889); 24 is the maximum score for any card combination without a 2 or a ten-card, except for the above examples with four 5s.\n The maximum score for any hand containing a 2 is 20; either 22229 or 26778 if the latter is a four-card flush.\n The highest score as a dealer from the hand and crib is 53. The starter must be a 5, the hand must be J555, with the Jack suit matching the starter (score 29), and the crib must be 4466 (score 24), or vice versa.\n The highest number of points possible (excluding pegging points) in one round is 77. The dealer must score 53, the opponent must then have the other 4466 making another 24 point hand for a total of 77.\n The highest number of points from a hand that has a potential to be a \"19 hand\" is 15. It is a crib hand of one suit, 46J and another ten card, with a 5 of that suit cut up. The points are 15 for 6, a run for 9, nobs for 10, and a flush for 15. Any of the following cards in an unlike suit yields a \"19 hand\"; 2,3,7,8,and an unpaired ten card.\n The most points that can be pegged by playing one card is 15, by completing a double pair royal on the last card and making the count 15: 12 for double pair royal, 2 for the 15, and 1 for the last card. This can happen in two ways in a two-player game. The non-dealer must have two ten-value cards and two 2s, and the dealer must have one ten-value card and 722, in which case the play must go: 10-10-10-go; 7-2-2-2-2. For example:\n\nAlternatively, the players can each have two deuces, with one also holding A-4 and the other two aces. Then play might go 4-A-A-A-2-2-2-2.\nThe maximum number of points that can be scored in a single deal by the dealer in a two player game is 78 (pegging + hand + crib):Non-dealer is dealt 3 3 4 4 5 J and Dealer is dealt 3 3 4 4 5 5. Non-dealer discards J 5 to the crib (as ill-advised as this may be). Dealer discards 5 5 to the crib. Note that the J is suited to the remaining 5. The remaining 5 is cut.Play is 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 go. The dealer scores 29 total peg points.The dealer's hand is 3 3 4 4 5 = 20The dealer's crib is J(nobs) 5 5 5 5 = 29The total score for the dealer is 29 + 20 + 29 = 78.Note that the correct play for both players is to keep 3 3 4 5 worth 10 points and discarding J 4 and 4 5 to the crib respectively, meaning in reality, this hand would never take place. A more realistic hand would be both players being dealt 3 3 4 4 J J with both discarding J J and a 5 cut. In this case, with pegging as described above, the total score would be 20 (hand) + 21 (crib) + 29 (pegging) = 70 points.\nThe maximum number of points that can be scored in a single deal by the non-dealer in a two player game is 48 (pegging + hand), with the following example :Non-dealer is dealt 5 5 4 4 crib crib and Dealer is dealt 4 4 5 9 crib crib. Cut card is a 6. Play is 5 5 5 4 4 4 4, with the Non-dealer pegging 24.",

It is the world's smallest independent state, covering an area of just 49 hectares (121 acres or 0.19 square miles). This tiny size is one of its defining features. Additionally, thirteen buildings in rome and castel gandolfo, such as the pope's summer residence, have extraterritorial rights, which also adds to its distinctive geography. The paul vi audience hall is another unique structure, as it straddles the border between vatican city and italy, and its italian portion has extraterritorial rights as well. \n\n<user> Climate and terrain of vatican city. \n\n<assistant> Vatican city's climate mirrors that of rome, which is temperate and mild. The city experiences rainy winters from september to mid-may, and hot, dry summers from may to september. As for the terrain, vatican city is situated on a low hill called the vatican hill or mons vaticanus. This hill has its historical significance as its name predates christianity. While it is believed that an etruscan settlement named vatica or vaticum might have existed in an area known to the ancient romans as \"vatican territory\" (vaticanus ager), no archaeological evidence of it has been discovered so far. \n\n<user> Can you give me information about the extreme points, land use, environment, and the international agreements of vatican city? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Vatican city has extreme points which are the farthest north, south, east, or west within the city-state, as well as its highest and lowest points. These are:\n\n- north: intersection of viale vaticano and via leone iv\n- south: intersection of via della stazione vaticana and via di porta cavalleggeri\n- west: intersection of viale vaticano and via aurelia\n- east: easternmost edge of saint peter's square\n\nThe lowest point is an unnamed location, while the highest point is also unnamed. St. Peter's basilica, at 452 feet (138 meters), is the tallest building in vatican city.\n\nRegarding land use, the nature of vatican city is fundamentally urban, with no significant agricultural land or natural resource exploitation. It is an excellent example of land economy due to its limited territory, with urban development occupying around half of the total area and the rest reserved for open spaces, including the vatican gardens.\n\nVatican city's environmental practices include accepting an offer in 2007 to become a carbon neutral state through the vatican climate forest in hungary, but no trees were planted, and the carbon offsets were not realized.\n\nAs for international agreements, vatican city is a party to the ozone layer protection agreement. It has also signed, but not ratified, agreements related to air pollution and environmental modification. \n\n<user> What about its rail line and train station? \n\n<assistant> Vatican city possesses a rail line and train station within its borders, which contributes to its autonomy as a sovereign state. The train station, known as vatican city railway station (stazione città del vaticano), is mainly used for freight transport, special trains for the pope and his entourage, and occasional tourist excursions. It is connected to italy's rail network and is mainly served by the italian state railways. The railway station, along with other facilities like a heliport, post office, radio station, military barracks, government offices, public plazas, and cultural institutions, enables the city-state to function independently and efficiently despite its small size.

        "reference": "The geography of Vatican City is unique due to the country's position as an urban, landlocked enclave of Rome, Italy. With an area of 49 ha (121 acres, or 0.19 sq mi), it is the world's smallest independent state. Outside the Vatican City, thirteen buildings in Rome and Castel Gandolfo (the pope's summer residence) enjoy extraterritorial rights. (One building, the Paul VI Audience Hall, straddles the border, but its Italian portion has extraterritorial rights.) The country contains no major natural resources, and no known natural hazards other than those that affect Rome in general, such as earthquakes.\n\nClimate\n\nThe city state has the same climate as Rome: temperate, mild, rainy winters (September to mid-May) with hot, dry summers (May to September).\n\nTerrain\n\nVatican City sits on a low hill. The hill has been called the Vatican Hill (in Latin, Mons Vaticanus) since long before Christianity existed.

The city state displays an impressive degree of land economy, born of necessity due to its extremely limited territory. Thus, the urban development (i.e., buildings) is optimized to occupy about half of the total area, while the rest is reserved for open space, including the Vatican Gardens. The territory holds many diverse structures that help provide autonomy for the sovereign state, including a rail line and train station, heliport, post office, radio station (with extraterritorial antennas in Italy), military barracks, government palaces and offices, public plaza, part of an audience hall, old defensive wall marking the border, institutions of higher learning, and cultural/art centers.\n\nEnvironment\nIn July 2007, the Vatican accepted an offer that would make it the only carbon neutral state for the year, due to the donation of the Vatican Climate Forest in Hungary. The forest was to be sized to offset the year's carbon dioxide emissions.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you explain supervenience in a simple way and tell me why it's important in philosophy? \n\n<assistant> Sure! Supervenience is a concept in philosophy that describes how one set of properties or facts, (let's call it x) depends on another set of properties or facts (let's call it y). X is said to supervene on y if there can't be any change in x without some change in y. Think of it like a building relying on its foundation - the building (x) can't change unless there's a change in the foundation (y).\n\nSupervenience is important in philosophy because it shows how two sets of properties or facts are connected without necessarily saying that one causes the other, which is different from other relationships like \"entailment,\" where one fact directly causes another. Philosophers use supervenience to study the connection between mental and physical properties or the relationship between moral/normative facts and natural facts, for example. By understanding supervenience, we can gain insight into how different aspects of reality are interconnected. \n\n<user> Can you give me more examples of supervenience? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Here are a few more examples of supervenience:\n\n1. The taste of a cake supervenes on its ingredients and their proportions. You cannot change the taste without changing the ingredients or their proportions in some way.\n\n2. The beauty of a painting supervenes on the arrangement of colors, shapes, and lines on the canvas. For the painting to be considered more or less beautiful, there must be a change in its visual composition.\n\n3. An ecosystem's health supervenes on the relationships between its living organisms, resources, and environmental factors. Change the ecosystem's health, and for that to happen, something about its organisms or environment has to change.\n\nThese examples illustrate how one set of properties or facts (e.g., taste, beauty, ecosystem health) is connected to and depends on another set of properties or facts (e.g., ingredients, visual composition, organisms/environment). Understanding these connections is important in philosophy, as it can help us investigate various phenomena without assuming direct causality or resorting to reductionist explanations. \n\n<user> How is the concept of supervenience applied to the mind-body problem and the is-ought problem in real-life situations? \n\n<assistant> Supervenience plays a significant role in addressing the mind-body problem and the is-ought problem in real-life situations.\n\nFor the mind-body problem, supervenience is used to explore the relationship between mental phenomena (like thoughts and emotions) and physical phenomena (like brain activity). Mental properties are said to supervene on physical properties. In real life, this implies that our mental experiences depend on our brain's physical processes. For instance, when a person feels pain, it is connected to specific neural activity in their brain. By understanding this connection, scientists and philosophers aim to develop better treatments for mental health issues and deepen our knowledge of consciousness.\n\nConcerning the is-ought problem, supervenience illustrates the connection between normative facts (how things should be, like moral values) and natural facts (the way things are, like factual descriptions). In real-life scenarios, people often face ethical dilemmas that require them to make decisions based on both normative and natural facts. For instance, when determining environmental policies, lawmakers must consider both the ecological facts about an ecosystem and ethical concerns about preserving nature. The concept of supervenience helps philosophers and policymakers explore these complex relationships and find grounded solutions to such problems.\n\nIn both cases, supervenience allows us to understand how different aspects of reality are interconnected without assuming a reductionist or direct causality approach, providing a broader perspective for informed decision-making. \n\n<user> What are the main challenges or debates when dealing with supervenience in philosophy? \n\n<assistant> There are several challenges and debates surrounding supervenience in philosophy. Some of the main ones include:\n\n1. Supervenience without entailment or reduction: an ongoing debate concerns whether it is possible for one set of properties to supervene on another without being entailed or reducible to the other set. Some philosophers argue that supervenience does not necessarily imply reduction or entailment, while others believe that it entails a reductive relationship.\n\n2. Competing formulations of supervenience: there are multiple ways to define and understand supervenience. Two primary formulations involve b-indiscernibility and a-indiscernibility or having specific a-properties and b-properties. Philosophers debate which definition is more accurate and useful in various philosophical contexts.\n\n3. The adequacy of supervenience for defining physicalism: some philosophers argue that supervenience is not enough to define or capture the essence of physicalism, the view that everything is physical or depends on the physical. They contend that supervenience might not provide a satisfactory explanation for mental-physical or moral-natural relationships.\n\n4. The explanatory power of supervenience: critics often question the extent to which supervenience can provide explanations for various phenomena. They argue that although supervenience describes dependency relationships between properties, it may not fully explain why these relationships exist or the underlying mechanisms.\n\nThese challenges and debates highlight the complexity of the concept of supervenience and its application to various philosophical inquiries. As philosophers continue to explore supervenience, they seek to refine its formulation, clarify its relationship to other philosophical concepts, and determine its explanatory value in understanding reality.

        "reference": "In philosophy, supervenience refers to a relation between sets of properties or sets of facts. X is said to supervene on Y if and only if some difference in Y is necessary for any difference in X to be possible. Here are some examples:\n\n Whether there is a table in the living room supervenes on the positions of molecules in the living room.\n The truth value of (A) supervenes on the truth value of (¬A). \n Properties of individual molecules supervene on the properties of individual atoms. \n One's moral character supervenes on one's action(s).\n\nThese are examples of supervenience because in each case the truth values of some propositions cannot vary unless the truth values of some other propositions vary.\n\nSupervenience is of interest to philosophers because it differs from other nearby relations, for example entailment. Some philosophers believe it possible for some A to supervene on some B without being entailed by B. In such cases it may seem puzzling why A should supervene on B and equivalently why changes in A should require changes in B. Two important applications of supervenience involve cases like this. One of these is the supervenience of mental properties (like the sensation of pain) on physical properties (like the firing of 'pain neurons'). A second is the supervenience of normative facts (facts about how things ought to be) on natural facts (facts about how things are).\n\nThese applications are elaborated below. But an illustrative note bears adding here. It is sometimes claimed that what is at issue in these problems is the supervenience claim itself. For example, it has been claimed that what is at issue with respect to the mind-body problem is whether mental phenomena do in fact supervene on physical phenomena. This is incorrect. It is by and large agreed that some form of supervenience holds in these cases: Pain happens when the appropriate neurons fire. The disagreement is over why this is so. Materialists claim that we observe supervenience because the neural phenomena entail the mental phenomena, while dualists deny this. The dualist's challenge is to explain supervenience without entailment.\n\nThe problem is similar with respect to the supervenience of normative facts on natural facts. Discussing the is-ought problem it is agreed that facts about how persons ought to act are not entailed by natural facts but cannot vary unless natural facts vary, and this rigid binding without entailment might seem puzzling.\n\nThe possibility of \"supervenience without entailment\" or \"supervenience without reduction\" is contested territory among philosophers.\n\nHistory \n\nSupervenience, which means literally \"coming or occurring as something novel, additional, or unexpected\", from \"super,\" meaning on, above, or additional, and \"venire,\" meaning to come in Latin, shows occurrences in the Oxford English Dictionary dating back to 1844.\n\nIts systematic use in philosophy is considered to have begun in early 20th-century meta-ethics and emergentism. As G.E. Moore wrote in 1922, \"if a given thing possesses any kind of intrinsic value in a certain degree, then... anything exactly like it, must, under all circumstances, possess it in exactly the same degree\" (p. 261). This usage also carried over into the work of R. M. Hare. For discussion of the emergentist roots of supervenience see Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Supervenience.\n\nIn the 1970s, Donald Davidson was the first to use the term to describe a broadly physicalist (and non-reductive) approach to the philosophy of mind, called anomalous monism. As he said in 1970, \"supervenience might be taken to mean that there cannot be two events alike in all physical respects but differing in some mental respects, or that an object cannot alter in some mental respects without altering in some physical respects.\"\n\nIn subsequent years Terence (\"Terry\") Horgan, David Lewis, and especially Jaegwon Kim formalized the concept and began applying it to many issues in the philosophy of mind. This raised numerous questions about how various formulations relate to one another, how adequate the formulation is to various philosophical tasks (in particular, the task of formulating physicalism), and whether it avoids or entails reductionism.\n\nDefinitions \n\nIn the contemporary literature, there are two primary (and non-equivalent) formulations of supervenience (for both definitions let A and B be sets of properties).\n\n(1) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if all things that are B-indiscernible are A-indiscernible.  Formally:\n\n(2) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if anything that has an A-property has some B-property such that anything that has that B-property also has that A-property.",

The incorporation of computer forecast models has also contributed to more accurate predictions and advanced warning systems for those in the path of tropical cyclones. \n\n<user> What are the main forces affecting tropical cyclone steering, and how do accurate track predictions depend on weather patterns? \n\n<assistant> The main forces that affect tropical cyclone steering are the higher latitude westerlies, the subtropical ridge, and the beta effect caused by changes in the coriolis force within fluids such as the atmosphere. These forces play a crucial role in determining the direction and speed at which a tropical cyclone moves.\n\nAccurate track predictions rely on determining the position and strength of high and low-pressure areas and predicting how these areas will migrate during the life of a tropical system. For example, cyclones tend to follow the outermost closed isobar of the subtropical ridge, making the strength and location of this high-pressure system vital for accurate predictions. The higher latitude westerlies can also impact the steering of a cyclone, with the storm following the direction of these prevailing winds.\n\nComputer forecast models are instrumental in helping meteorologists understand these steering forces and making predictions about cyclone tracks as far out as five to seven days into the future. These models use historical data, current observations, and complex mathematical algorithms to simulate atmospheric conditions and project the future movement of tropical cyclones.\n\nWhen it comes to the weather patterns and their effect on accurate track predictions, it is essential to accurately monitor high and low-pressure systems, wind patterns, and other atmospheric conditions that are known to influence tropical cyclones. Generally, the better the data and understanding of the surrounding weather systems, the more accurate the track forecast will be.\n\nAdditionally, certain weather patterns can act as early indicators of an approaching tropical cyclone. An increase in cloudiness, falling barometric pressure, rising tides, and heavy rainfall can all serve as signs that a cyclone is approaching a specific location. By recognizing and understanding these patterns, meteorologists have a better chance of making accurate track predictions and issuing appropriate warnings to those in the path of the storm. \n\n<user> How can we predict the passage of a tropical cyclone based on ocean swell and wind patterns? \n\n<assistant> Predicting the passage of a tropical cyclone based on ocean swell and wind patterns involves paying attention to a few key changes in the environment. About four days in advance of a typical tropical cyclone, an ocean swell of about 1 meter (3.3 feet) in height will roll in approximately every 10 seconds. The swell moves toward the coast from the direction of the tropical cyclone's location. As the storm approaches, the ocean swell will gradually increase in height and frequency.\n\nTwo days in advance of the center's passage, winds may go calm since the tropical cyclone interrupts the environmental wind flow. Within 36 hours of the cyclone's center passing through a particular location, the barometric pressure begins to fall, and a veil of white cirrus clouds can be observed approaching from the cyclone's direction. These changes in ocean swell, wind patterns, and atmospheric conditions help forecasters predict when a tropical cyclone is nearing a specific area.\n\nIt is important to note that the changes in ocean swell and wind patterns are only a few of many indicators used by meteorologists in tropical cyclone forecasting. Other factors, such as satellite data and computer forecast models, play a significant role in making more accurate predictions and providing advanced warnings for people potentially in the storm's path.

It is based on the belief that land and its resources are common goods, and that access to these resources should not be exclusive or lead to inequality.\n\nA key concept in georgism is the implementation of a single tax on land values, also called land value tax (lvt). This tax would replace other taxes, particularly those on income and capital gains. Proponents of georgism argue that the lvt would promote a more productive and just society by reducing wealth disparities and eliminating land speculation.\n\nBy taxing land value and not the improvements made upon it, georgism encourages efficient land use and discourages unproductive land hoarding. This, in turn, fosters economic growth, improves urban planning, and mitigates some of the negative effects of land speculation. Additionally, georgism contends that public revenue generated through lvt can be used to fund essential services and infrastructure projects, further benefiting society as a whole.\n\nOverall, georgism's main principles focus on promoting economic justice, reducing wealth inequality, and ensuring that everyone has the right to benefit from the value of land and natural resources. \n\n<user> Can you provide more insight into henry george's background and how it might have influenced his beliefs and ideas presented in his works, particularly in \"progress and poverty\"? \n\n<assistant> Henry george was born into a lower-middle-class family in philadelphia as the second of ten children. His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout episcopalian. George's early education took place at the episcopal academy in philadelphia, but he didn't complete his studies. Instead, he chose to have a private tutor and supplemented his education by reading avidly and attending lectures at the franklin institute. His formal education ended at age 14, after which he went to sea and later worked as a typesetter in san francisco.\n\nGeorge's personal experiences and observations during his life played a crucial role in shaping his economic beliefs and ideas. In san francisco, he witnessed the harsh realities of poverty, wealth disparity, and the manipulation of resources by powerful interest groups like railroads and land speculators. These observations, combined with his own struggles and near-starvation, fueled his passion for understanding and addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality.\n\nWhen he wrote \"progress and poverty\" in 1879, george sought to investigate the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty in the midst of economic and technological advancement. The book analyzes the cyclic nature of industrialized economies and explores the use of rent capture, such as land value tax and other anti-monopoly reforms, as potential remedies for social problems. His background, hardships, and experiences provided a solid foundation for his thoughts and contributed to his conviction that economic reform was necessary to achieve a more just and equitable society. \n\n<user> How were henry george's ideas received during his lifetime, and what influence did they have on politicians and reform movements? \n\n<assistant> During his lifetime, henry george's ideas gained significant popularity both in the united states and across other anglophone countries. His most famous work, \"progress and poverty,\" sold millions of copies worldwide and established him as a prominent economic thinker of his time. His writings and speeches garnered the attention of the masses and sparked several reform movements of the progressive era.\n\nGeorge's economic philosophy, georgism, influenced politicians, organizations, and political leaders in the united states and abroad. His ideas on land value taxation and other anti-monopoly reforms were embraced by several political parties, like the united labor party and the jefferson democracy party. In fact, george himself ran for the office of mayor of new york city in 1886 and 1897 as a candidate for these parties, receiving 31% and 4% of the votes, respectively.\n\nAlthough george's ideas did not achieve widespread implementation during his lifetime, they continued to inspire and influence later generations of reformers and politicians who sought to address issues of wealth inequality and economic justice. Henry george's advocacy for land value taxation, free trade, the secret ballot, and public ownership of certain natural monopolies left a lasting impact on economic thought and public policy, fostering discussions and debates on these topics that persist even today.\n\nAfter george's death, his legacy was carried forward by organizations and leaders who were committed to the principles of georgism. It's worth noting that george soule, a mid-20th century labor economist and journalist, referred to henry george as \"the most famous american economic writer\" and highlighted the tremendous global reach of his works. \n\n<user> Apart from \"progress and poverty,\" what other works did henry george write, and what are their main concepts? \n\n<assistant> In addition to \"progress and poverty,\" henry george authored several other works that expanded on his economic philosophy and explored various topics of interest. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n1. \"our land and land policy\" (1871): this book, written prior to \"progress and poverty,\" outlined george's initial thoughts on land policy and land value taxation.\n\n2. \"social problems\" (1883): in this work, george delved into various social issues facing the united states during his time, emphasizing the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources to address these challenges.\n\n3. \"protection or free trade\" (1886): this book offered a thorough examination of the debate between protectionism and free trade. George advocated for free trade as a policy that would better serve the interests of society and promote justice and economic growth.\n\n4. \"the condition of labor\" (1891): george responded to pope leo xiii's encyclical \"rerum novarum\" with this open letter, defending his land value tax proposal and further discussing labor and social issues.\n\n5. \"a perplexed philosopher\" (1892): in this book, george critiqued the economic theories of herbert spencer, a prominent philosopher and sociologist of the 19th century. He aimed to highlight inconsistencies within spencer's ideas and defend the principles of georgism.\n\n6. \"the science of political economy\" (1898): published posthumously, this work was george's attempt to provide a comprehensive and systematic treatise on political economy, encapsulating his life's work and economic thought.\n\nThese works reflect george's commitment to addressing social and economic issues, as well as his dedication to spreading the principles of georgism throughout multiple areas of public policy and debate. His persistent advocacy for land value taxation, free trade, and social reforms earned him recognition as a key figure in the history of economic thought. ",

Other works by George defended free trade, the secret ballot, and public ownership of certain natural monopolies.\n\nA journalist for many years, the popularity of his writing and speeches brought him to run for election as Mayor of New York City in 1886 as the United Labor Party nominee and in 1897 as the Jefferson Democracy Party nominee, receiving 31 percent and 4 percent of the vote respectively and finishing ahead of former New York State Assembly Minority Leader Theodore Roosevelt in the first race. After his death during the second campaign, his ideas were carried forward by organizations and political leaders through the United States and other Anglophone countries. The mid-20th century labor economist and journalist George Soule wrote that George was by far \"the most famous American economic writer\" and \"author of a book which probably had a larger world-wide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nGeorge was born in Philadelphia to a lower-middle-class family, the second of ten children of Richard S. H. George and Catharine Pratt George (née Vallance). His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout Episcopalian, and he sent George to the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia. George chafed at his religious upbringing and left the academy without graduating. Instead he convinced his father to hire a tutor and supplemented this with avid reading and attending lectures at the Franklin Institute. His formal education ended at age 14, and he went to sea as a foremast boy at age 15 in April 1855 on the Hindoo, bound for Melbourne and Calcutta. He ended up in the American West in 1858 and briefly considered prospecting for gold but instead started work the same year in San Francisco as a type setter.\n\nIn California, George fell in love with Annie Corsina Fox from Sydney, Australia. They met on her seventeenth birthday on October 12, 1860. She had been orphaned and was living with an uncle. The uncle, a prosperous, strong-minded man, was opposed to his niece's impoverished suitor. But the couple, defying him, eloped and married on December 3, 1861, with Henry dressed in a borrowed suit and Annie bringing only a packet of books.\n\nThe marriage was a happy one, and four children were born to them. On November 3, 1862 Annie gave birth to future United States Representative from New York, Henry George Jr. (1862–1916). Early on, even with the birth of future sculptor Richard F. George (1865–1912), the family was near starvation. George's other two children were both daughters. The first was Jennie George, (c. 1867–1897), later to become Jennie George Atkinson. George's other daughter was Anna Angela George (1878-1947), who would become mother of both future dancer and choreographer, Agnes de Mille and future actress Peggy George, who was born Margaret George de Mille.\n\nFollowing the birth of his second child George had no work and no money and had to beg for food. As he approached the first well-dressed stranger he saw in the street, George, normally a lawful man, decided to rob him if he was unwilling to help. Fortunately, the man took pity on him and gave him five dollars.\n\nGeorge was raised as an Episcopalian, but he believed in \"deistic humanitarianism\". His wife Annie was Irish Catholic, but Henry George Jr. wrote that the children were mainly influenced by Henry George's deism and humanism.\n\nCareer in journalism \n\nAfter deciding against gold mining in British Columbia, George was hired as a printer for the newly created San Francisco Times. He was able to immediately submit editorials for publication, including the popular What the Railroads Will Bring Us, which remained required reading in California schools for decades.  George climbed the ranks of the Times, eventually becoming managing editor in the summer of 1867.  George worked for several papers, including four years (1871–1875) as editor of his own newspaper, the San Francisco Daily Evening Post, and for a time running the Reporter, a Democratic anti-monopoly publication.  George experienced four tough years of trying to keep his newspaper afloat and was eventually forced to go to the streets to beg. The George family struggled, but George's improving reputation and involvement in the newspaper industry lifted them from poverty.\n\nPolitical and economic philosophy\nGeorge began as a Lincoln Republican, but then became a Democrat. He was a strong critic of railroad and mining interests, corrupt politicians, land speculators, and labor contractors. He first articulated his views in an 1868 article entitled \"What the Railroad Will Bring Us.\" George argued that the boom in railroad construction would benefit only the lucky few who owned interests in the railroads and other related enterprises, while throwing the greater part of the population into abject poverty. This had led to him earning the enmity of the Central Pacific Railroad's executives, who helped defeat his bid for election to the California State Assembly.\n\nOne day in 1871 George went for a horseback ride and stopped to rest while overlooking San Francisco Bay. He later wrote of the revelation that he had:\n\nFurthermore, on a visit to New York City, he was struck by the apparent paradox that the poor in that long-established city were much worse off than the poor in less developed California. These observations supplied the theme and title for his 1879 book Progress and Poverty, which was a great success, selling over three million copies.",

During the Middle Ages, it was known as \"the road to Reading\" or \"the way from Colnbrook.\" Its importance grew during the Tudor period when property development and speculation became a lucrative business, as expansion beyond London's city walls became safer.\n\nThe plot of land on which Piccadilly now stands was granted to William Dodington by Elizabeth I in 1559-60, and later it was owned by a brewer named Thomas Wilson. A small parcel of land, which may have never belonged to the Crown, was owned by Anthony Cotton during the reign of Henry VIII. His descendant, John Cotton, granted it to John Golightly in 1547. This plot was eventually sold to a tailor named Robert Baker around 1611-12.\n\nBaker became financially successful by making and selling a type of collar called piccadills. After purchasing the land, he enclosed it and built several dwellings, including a residence and shop for himself. This marked the beginning of the street's development. Over time, Piccadilly saw the construction of notable stately homes like Clarendon House, Burlington House, and Devonshire House.\n\nIn the 18th century, the street became the location for booksellers and famous coaching inns like the Old White Horse Cellar. In the following century, the Ritz Hotel was built on the site of the Bath Hotel and Walsingham House. Piccadilly became infamous in the 1960s as the center of London's illegal drug trade.\n\nToday, Piccadilly is considered one of London's principal shopping streets, with landmarks such as the Ritz, Park Lane, Athenaeum and Intercontinental hotels, Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy, the RAF Club, Hatchards, the Embassy of Japan, and the High Commission of Malta. The street has also inspired works of fiction by authors like Oscar Wilde and P.G. Wodehouse and is included on the London Monopoly board. \n\n<user> What is the significance of burlington house and the societies housed there? \n\n<assistant> Burlington house is a historically significant building located on the northern side of piccadilly. It was built in 1664 and has since played an important role in various aspects of british society. Throughout its long history, the building has been home to several notable societies, each of which has contributed significantly to their respective fields.\n\nThe royal academy of arts is one such prestigious institution housed within burlington house. Established in 1768, it is an independent, privately funded institution that promotes the creation, enjoyment, and appreciation of visual arts through exhibitions, education, and debate. As one of the foremost art institutions in the united kingdom, its mission is to serve as a voice for art and artists.\n\nThe geological society of london, founded in 1807, is also based at burlington house. It is the oldest national geological society in the world and is dedicated to the promotion of earth sciences for the benefit of the public. The society holds regular meetings, publishes scientific literature, and hosts various educational activities.\n\nThe royal astronomical society, formed in 1820, is another organization housed in burlington house. This learned society focuses on astronomy and geophysics, and its membership comprises scientists and enthusiasts from around the world. The society organizes scientific meetings, publishes research, awards grants for scientific projects, and engages in a wide range of outreach activities to promote public understanding of astronomy and geophysics.\n\nThese notable societies, along with others based at burlington house, contribute to the building's significance and its crucial role in fostering intellectual and scientific progress. Burlington house serves not only as a shared physical space for these institutions but also as a symbol of cooperation, shared knowledge, and advancement in various academic disciplines.\n\nBy providing a home for these societies, burlington house has played an essential role in the promotion of art, science, and education throughout its history. Its presence on piccadilly highlights the street's importance in london's cultural and intellectual landscape, making it a key destination for anyone interested in the rich history of the city and the disciplines it has helped nurture and develop. \n\n<user> Can you tell me more about Piccadilly Circus station and its unique design? \n\n<assistant> Piccadilly circus station is a unique and historically significant underground station located at the eastern end of piccadilly street in london. Designed by renowned british architect charles holden, the station was built between 1925 and 1928. It stands out due to its architectural style and the fact that it was the first underground station in london to have no above-ground premises.\n\nHolden's design for the station features a modern and minimalist aesthetic, with a focus on functional elements and clean lines. The absence of above-ground buildings means that the station is only accessible through subways from street level. This innovative approach gives the station a distinctive look and feel, setting it apart from other underground stations in the city.\n\nThe use of subways for access was a groundbreaking concept at the time and marked a shift in the design of underground stations. Eliminating above-ground buildings allowed for a more efficient use of urban space while simultaneously reducing the visual impact of the station on the surrounding area.\n\nIn addition to its unique design features, piccadilly circus station is also historically significant due to its role in the development of london's transportation infrastructure. Opened in 1906 as part of the bakerloo line, the station was later expanded to accommodate the increasing number of passengers when the piccadilly line was extended in 1928.\n\nToday, piccadilly circus station remains a major transportation hub and an important part of london's underground network. It serves both the bakerloo and piccadilly lines and provides convenient access to numerous attractions, shops, and theaters nearby. The station's innovative design and its role in shaping london's transportation history make it an interesting and noteworthy landmark on piccadilly street. ",

Youkilis was a two-time world series champion, having experienced ultimate success on the biggest stage of the sport.\n\nIn 2008, youkilis was awarded the prestigious hank aaron award, given to the top offensive player in each league, an acknowledgment of his outstanding performance at the plate. He was also a gold glove award-winning first baseman, which is awarded to the best defensive player at each position. At one point in his career, youkilis held the record for most consecutive errorless games at first base, which reflects his exceptional fielding.\n\nDespite his unconventional physique, which often led people to underestimate his athletic ability, youkilis was recognized for his achievements by being named to sporting news' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. He ranked no. 36 on the list in 2009, no. 38 in 2010, and no. 35 in 2011, consistently proving his worth as one of the top players in the sport. \n\n<user> His unique batting stance and playing style? \n\n<assistant> Kevin youkilis was known for his unusual batting stance and intense playing style. His batting stance involved an unconventional setup where he would hold the bat with his hands spread apart and keep his feet comparatively close together. As the pitcher initiated the windup, youkilis would then bring his hands together and raise his leg to gain better leverage and timing. While this approach made his stance appear unorthodox and somewhat awkward, it worked effectively for him as it helped him generate power and maintain excellent plate discipline.\n\nIn addition to his peculiar batting stance, youkilis had a gritty and spirited playing style. He was known for his determination, scrappiness, and willingness to do whatever it took to help his team win. His jerseys were often covered in dirt due to his hustle on the field and his fearless nature, such as diving headfirst into bases and engaging in home-plate collisions. This intense approach to the game earned him respect from teammates, opponents, and fans alike.\n\nYoukilis' style was quite distinctive; rather than relying on pure athleticism or physical prowess, he relied on his understanding of the game, his work ethic, and his perseverance to succeed. Despite being labeled as \"roly-poly,\" \"pudgy,\" or even a \"fat kid\" by coaches and managers, he proved that hard work and dedication can lead to great success in baseball.

Youkilis himself identifies as jewish and had a bar mitzvah at a conservative synagogue in his youth. His father was known to play third base in the local jewish community center fast-pitch softball league, so baseball was part of his upbringing.\n\nThe youkilis family name has an interesting history as well. Kevin's jewish great-great-great-grandfather, originally from romania, moved to greece at the age of 16 to avoid conscription by the anti-semitic cossacks. Feeling homesick, he later returned to romania, changing his surname from \"weiner\" to \"youkilis\" to avoid the army and facing imprisonment.\n\nIn his younger years, youkilis had a brief uncredited one-line role in the romantic comedy film milk money when he was 14 years old. He attended sycamore high school, playing baseball in various positions such as third base, shortstop, first base, and the outfield. It is worth noting that youkilis was the only player to hit a home run off his future red sox teammate aaron cook in high school.\n\nYoukilis later attended the university of cincinnati (uc), choosing it over butler university, partly because his father and his idol, sandy koufax, were alumni of uc. During his time at the university of cincinnati, he played college baseball and worked towards achieving his dream of playing in the major leagues. ",

        "reference": "Chano Domínguez (born Sebastián Domínguez Lozano; 29 March  1960, Cádiz) is a Spanish Latin jazz, post bop and flamenco pianist. Dominguez has released over 20 albums as a bandleader, and collaborated extensively with other jazz artists including Paquito D’Rivera,  Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Joe Lovano, Chucho Valdes, Martiro, and Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, He performs his own original compositions, as well as the music of Harold Arlen, Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, and the Spanish classical composer, Joaquin Rodrigo. He was nominated for a GRAMMY Award in 2012 for his album Flamenco Sketches on the Blue Note label.\n\nDomínguez began his career in the progressive rock group CAI before moving on to jazz. They recorded three LPs from 1978 to 1980, Mas Alla de Nuestras Mentes Diminutas, Noche Abierta and Cancion de Primavera for the Columbia label. After CAI broke up in the early 1980s, Dominguez joined the local, Cadiz-based jazz ensemble, Hixcadix.\n\nDomínguez's initial interest in jazz came from jazz fusion groups like Mahavishnu Orchestra or Weather Report, but later he became interested in Bill Evans and Thelonious Monk. In 1992, he formed his first jazz trio, and won First Prize in the National Jazz Competition for Young Performers that same year, and released his first recording as a leader, Chano, in 1993, followed by Diez de Paco in 1994. From there, Dominguez recorded a number of  projects, including Coplas de Madruga, with the Spanish flamenco singer Martyr.\n\nDomínguez's greatest international exposure came in the year 2000, courtesy of his performance of his composition, “Oye Como Viene,” in Spanish director Fernando Trueba’s Grammy Award-winning Latin jazz documentary, Calle 54, which also featured Elaine Elias, Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band and Tito Puente. Dominguez has also been nominated for three Latin Grammys, including two in the \"Best Flamenco Album\" category: a 2002 collaboration with singer Martirio called Mucho Corazon, and a 2015 collaboration with singer Blas Cordoba, AKA “El Keijo”, called Bendito.\n\nDomínguez performs as both a solo artist and in collaboration with a number of different artists and combos. Domínguez performs regularly in a trio with bassist Horacio Fumero and drummer David Xirgu, another trio with bassist Alexis Cuadrado and drummer Henry Cole; as well as various duets with longtime collaborator bassist Javier Colina, a flutist Hadar Noiberg, and pianist Steffano Bolani.\n\nDomínguez’ s Flamenco Quartet performs the classic compositions of Manuel de Falla, Isaac Albeniz, Enrique Granados, and Federico Mompou, with percussionist Pablo Dominguez and singer Blas Cordoba and dancer Daniel Navarro. In 2018, Dominguez debuted his quintet consisting of himself, Cuadrado, Cole, Cordoba and Navarro.\n\nIn addition to his recording and performing career, Domínguez has taught at Juilliard, the Taller de Músics in Barcelona, the Bogotá Conservatory, and the University of Washington School of Music, among other institutions.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Who was henry of ghent and why was he known as the solemn doctor? \n\n<assistant> Henry of ghent, also known as henricus de gandavo and henricus gandavensis, was a prominent scholastic philosopher born around 1217 in the district of mude, near ghent. He earned the title \"doctor solemnis\" (the solemn doctor) due to the significance of his philosophical and theological works during his lifetime.\n\nHenry began his studies in ghent before moving on to study under albertus magnus in cologne. After obtaining his doctorate, he returned to ghent and became the first to publicly lecture on philosophy and theology in the city. Later, he moved to paris, drawn by the prestigious university there. During his time in paris, he took part in various disputes between the religious orders and secular priests, siding with the secular clergy.\n\nKnown for his strong platonist influence, henry made several noteworthy contributions to medieval philosophy. Among these are his discussions on the concepts of \"being of essence,\" the \"intentional distinction,\" \"illumination,\" and the criteria for \"scientific knowledge.\" his work on essence, in particular, laid the groundwork for the later formal distinction developed by john duns scotus.\n\nThroughout his life, henry was involved in several controversies, including the condemnations of 1277 and debates over the obligation to confess sins to a parish priest. He passed away on june 29, 1293, in either tournai or paris. \n\n<user> Can you please explain henry's ideas regarding the being of essence? also, how does his concept of 'somethingness' fit into this idea? and, what is esse latissimum? \n\n<assistant> In henry of ghent's philosophy, he proposed the idea of the being of essence (esse essentiae), which suggests that individual living beings have a being that corresponds to their particular essence. He argued that god creates each being's essence, but the created essence doesn't equate to the actual existence of the being.\n\nIn addition to the being of essence, henry also introduced the concept of 'somethingness' (aliquitas). He believed that beings have a unique 'somethingness' that distinguishes them from others, further defining their essence.\n\nAccording to henry, the process of determining and actualizing a being's essence and 'somethingness' unfolds in a series of stages. First, there is the esse essentiae, which comes from divine creation. Next, there is the esse aliquid per essentiam, referring to the state of being a 'something' due to the being's essence. Lastly, the fully-formed essence is actualized through god’s act.\n\nThe term esse latissimum refers to the being in the widest sense or the most general form of being. Esse latissimum, also called esse communissimum, is the broadest notion of being, encompassing both the being of essence and existence. In henry's view, the determination of essence depends on actual existence. In other words, the act in which an essence is actualized and specified through another act is what delimits and creates a distinct being. \n\n<user> What is an intentional distinction according to henry of ghent's philosophy? can you provide an example to better explain this concept and how it differs from logical and real distinctions? \n\n<assistant> In henry of ghent's philosophy, an intentional distinction represents how different concepts express the same thing in distinct ways. Unlike a purely logical distinction, which involves separating concepts mentally without implying a real composition, an intentional distinction always suggests a mild composition that falls short of the level implied by a real distinction.\n\nTo better understand this concept, consider the example of the terms 'rational' and 'animal' when applied to a human being. The distinction between these terms isn't purely logical because one doesn't define the other. At the same time, it's not a real distinction, as that would imply that the combination of 'animal' and 'rational' within an individual is entirely accidental. Instead, henry proposes an intermediate, intentional distinction that acknowledges a level of composition between the terms without committing to either extreme.\n\nThe intentional distinction concept was later developed and refined by john duns scotus into the formal distinction. This development expanded and clarified the idea of distinguishing features of a single thing or entity that are neither purely logical nor entirely separate in reality. Henry's intentional distinction laid the foundations for this crucial concept in medieval philosophy. \n\n<user> In henry's philosophy, how did he reconcile elements of platonism and aristotelianism, especially regarding universals and their existence? additionally, how did his view of the intimate connection between the soul and body differ from other philosophers of his time, and what are some characteristics of the soul and body according to his perspective? \n\n<assistant> Henry of ghent's philosophy exhibited a strong platonist influence, and he sought to harmonize platonism with aristotelian thought. His approach to the question of universals illustrates this reconciliation. He believed that universals exist in two different manners: in reference to the human mind and in reference to the divine mind. In the divine intelligence, henry argued that there are exemplars or types for the genera and species of natural objects, echoing platonic ideas or forms. However, he also acknowledged the aristotelian view that universals exist in real objects outside of pure thought.\n\nIn reconciling plato and aristotle, henry defended plato against contemporary aristotelian criticism and demonstrated that the two views could be harmonized by understanding the existence of universals both in the intellect and within the actual objects.\n\nRegarding the soul and body, henry's view was distinctive for his time. He claimed that the body forms a part of the substance of the soul, rather than viewing the soul as a separate, non-material substance. Through the union of soul and body, the soul achieves a more perfect and complete state. This perspective differed from other philosophers who often regarded the soul and body as distinct substances. In henry's view, the soul and body's intimate connection emphasizes their interdependence and highlights the importance of the physical realm in constituting a being's identity. ",

        "reference": "Henry of Ghent (c. 1217 – 29 June 1293) was a scholastic philosopher, known as Doctor Solemnis (the \"Solemn Doctor\"), and also as Henricus de Gandavo and Henricus Gandavensis.\n\nLife \nHenry was born in the district of Mude, near Ghent. He is supposed to have belonged to an Italian family named Bonicolli, in Dutch Goethals, but the question of his name has been much discussed (see authorities below). He studied at Ghent and then at Cologne under Albertus Magnus. After obtaining the degree of doctor he returned to Ghent, and is said to have been the first to lecture there publicly on philosophy and theology.\n\nAttracted to Paris by the fame of the university, he took part in the many disputes between the orders and the secular priests, on the side of the latter. While Henry was a regent master at the University of Paris, the Condemnations of 1277 took place. The bishop of Paris, Stephen Tempier, promulgated a condemnation of some 219 propositions put forth by the masters of the Faculty of Theology.  Henry had a hand in the creation of these propositions and because of that he was summoned to the papal legate after a fellow Augustinian, Giles of Rome. The summons was supposed to change Henry's mind concerning Thomas Aquinas and his unicity thesis (which stated that the human soul, the substantial form of the body, is the undivided principle of the individual's life, sensitivity and rationality). Following the publication of the papal bull Ad fructus uberes by Pope Martin IV in 1281, Henry supported the secular clergy against the Mendicant Orders over the question of the 'reiteration of confession' (the obligation to confess to their parish priest, at least once a year, sins already confessed to a friar). Henry was engaged in this violent controversy for the rest of his life.  He died at Tournai (or Paris).\n\nWork\n\nBeing of essence \nHenry argued that not only do individual creatures have a being corresponding to their essence - the being of essence or esse essentiae, they also have a 'somethingness' (aliquitas). The being created by God is not the being of actual existence, but the being of essence, also called esse latissimum (being in the widest sense), or esse communissimum, the most general form of being. The determination of essence respecting its being made actual is a delimitation, or specification, of that being. Thus, esse essentiae comes first, then comes esse aliquid per essentiam, being a something through essence, finally the whole essence thus made up is put into actuality.\n\nIntentional distinction \n\nAn intentional distinction is where the very same thing is expressed by different concepts in different ways (Quodl. V, q. 12). Unlike a purely logical distinction, an intentional distinction always implies a sort of composition, although it is minor with regard to that implied by a distinction in reality.\n\nFor example, rational and animal, as they are found in man, is not a distinction of reason, since one is not a definition of the other. Nor is a real distinction, otherwise the conjunction of 'animal' and 'rational' in some particular person would be purely accidental (per accidens). Therefore, there must be some intermediate distinction, which Henry defines as 'intentional'. This principle was later developed by Scotus into the formal distinction.\n\nIllumination \n\nHenry's doctrines are infused by a strong Platonism. He distinguished between knowledge of actual objects and the divine inspiration by which we cognize the being and existence of God. The first throws no light upon the second. Individuals are constituted not by the material element but by their independent existence, i.e. ultimately by the fact that they are created as separate entities. Universals must be distinguished according as they have reference to our minds or to the divine mind. In the divine intelligence exist exemplars or types of the genera and species of natural objects.\n\nOn this subject Henry is far from clear; but he defends Plato against the current Aristotelian criticism, and endeavours to show that the two views are in harmony. In psychology, his view of the intimate union of soul and body is remarkable. The body he regards as forming part of the substance of the soul, which through this union is more perfect and complete.\n\nScientific knowledge \n\nHenry's standards for truth exceeded what is now commonly accepted in science. Following closely Aristotle's Posterior Analytics, he demanded that \"First, it must be certain, i.e. exclusive of deception and doubt; secondly, it must be of a necessary object; thirdly, it must be produced by a cause that is evident to the intellect; fourthly, it must be applied to the object by a syllogistic reasoning process\". He thus excluded from the realm of the knowable anything about contingent objects. In this respect he was contradicted by his younger contemporary Duns Scotus.",

It spans a total length of approximately 57.46 miles (92.47 km), connecting numerous towns and cities in ohio, including mutual, plain city, dublin, and new albany. Columbus, the capital of ohio, is another significant city that sr 161 passes through.\n\nEstablished in 1924, the original purpose of sr 161 was to connect plain city and dublin. Over time, the route was expanded to include mutual and granville. In dublin and new albany, parts of the highway were upgraded to a freeway in 1969 and 1997, respectively.\n\nAlong sr 161, you will find various intersections, interchanges, and points of interest. The route begins in mutual at a t-intersection with state route 29, and its eastern terminus is near alexandria at state route 37. Some notable junctions along the way include a concurrency with sr 4, an interchange with us 33 and post road, and cloverleaf interchanges with interstate 270 (i-270).\n\nIn dublin, sr 161 transitions from a freeway to an at-grade highway, and the route passes through downtown dublin, where it intersects state route 745 and state route 257. Additionally, it encounters state route 315 in a diamond interchange in worthington and crosses paths with us 23 at an at-grade intersection.\n\nAs sr 161 makes its way through columbus, it intersects with state route 710, has an interchange with interstate 71, and later becomes a limited-access freeway as minerva park is reached. The route re-enters columbus and has an interchange with i-270 before entering new albany, where it ultimately ends at state route 37.\n\nA part of the big darby plains scenic byway, sr 161's sections from homer road to rosedale road and from kramer road to us 33 are included in the byway.\n\nThroughout its history, sr 161 has undergone various expansions, changes, and improvements, including the creation of a bypass around new albany and the northwest expressway transformation project that began in 2004. \n\n<user> What is the history of sr 161's expansion and improvements? \n\n<assistant> Over the years, ohio state route 161 (sr 161) has experienced several expansions and improvements as the area developed and transportation needs grew. The route was initially established in 1924 to connect plain city and dublin. At that time, its eastern end was a junction with sr 21, which sat approximately five miles (8.0 km) west of dublin.\n\nLater, sr 161 was expanded to include an unnumbered section between mutual and plain city, and then dublin and granville. In 1938, a concurrency from five miles (8.0 km) west of dublin to dublin itself was changed from sr 31 to us 33. Several decades later, in 1969, the five-mile section in dublin was upgraded to a freeway.\n\nThe section between interstate 71 (i-71) and sunbury road received an upgrade as well, becoming a divided highway in 1976. In 1997, a bypass was created around new albany, spanning from i-270 to a point two miles (3.2 km) east of it, which led to a change in sr 161's route to use the bypass and avoid new albany's downtown area. The bypass project was completed in 2000.\n\nThe ohio department of transportation initiated the northwest expressway transformation in 2004, with the goal of replacing 17 bridges, 18 ramps, and five miles of highway. These expansions and improvements have helped alleviate traffic congestion, enhance safety, and support economic development along the corridor. \n\n<user> Can you explain more about the big darby plains scenic byway? \n\n<assistant> The big darby plains scenic byway is a picturesque route in ohio that showcases the beauty of the darby plains landscape. Spanning more than 100 miles, the byway traverses madison, union, and champaign counties, offering travelers scenic views of rural ohio, including its farmlands, wetlands, and historic landmarks. The route highlights the region's significant natural resources and provides glimpses of the big darby creek, which is a designated national scenic river.\n\nTwo sections of ohio state route 161 (sr 161) are part of the big darby plains scenic byway. The first section runs from homer road to rosedale road, while the second section stretches from kramer road to us 33. These segments contribute to the overall beauty and charm of the scenic byway, offering an enjoyable driving experience for those who travel along sr 161.\n\nThe big darby plains scenic byway serves as a gateway to the surrounding region, offering opportunities to explore local parks, nature preserves, historic sites, and other points of interest. It not only showcases the natural beauty of the area but also promotes tourism and encourages visitors to experience rural ohio.\n\nWhile traveling the scenic byway, visitors can immerse themselves in the region's rich history, admire the diverse and unique flora and fauna of the area, and appreciate ohio's commitment to preserving its natural resources. The byway's picturesque views and recreational opportunities make it a popular destination for nature enthusiasts, history buffs, and road trippers alike. ",

Eriocaulon is a genus of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as pipeworts, belonging to the eriocaulaceae family. The scientific name \"eriocaulon\" is derived from two ancient greek words: \"εριον\" (erion) meaning 'wool' and \"καυλός\" (kaulós) meaning 'stalk'. This name describes the wool-like appearance of the plant stalks.\n\nThe eriocaulon genus consists of about 400 species that are widely distributed. They are predominantly found in tropical regions, with southern asia and the americas being the centers of diversity. A few species can be found in temperate regions, with around 10 species in the united states (mainly in the southern states), two species in canada, and approximately 35 species in china (mostly in the southern parts). One species, e. Aquaticum, occurs in europe along the atlantic ocean coasts of scotland and ireland and is believed to be a relatively recent natural colonist in europe.\n\nEriocaulon plants are mostly herbaceous perennials, although some are annuals. They are often found in wet habitats, such as wetlands, wet savannas like flatwoods, and shallow water. Their abundance in wet soils is affected by various factors, including water levels, fire frequency, and competition from other plants, especially grasses. Experiments have revealed that eriocaulon species are weak competitors compared to many other wetland plants.\n\nThe flowers of eriocaulon plants resemble those of the related cyperaceae (sedges) and juncaceae (rushes) families. They have small, wind-pollinated flowers, allowing them to disperse their pollen across distances without the need for pollinators like insects or birds. \n\n<user> That's fascinating! could you tell me more about their appearance? since they have small flowers and are wind-pollinated, are their flowers still colorful? and what differences can be seen between the various eriocaulon species in terms of their overall structure and appearance? \n\n<assistant> Eriocaulon plants, often known as pipeworts, share several characteristic features. They typically have slender, grass-like leaves and unbranched stems that are often covered in fine hair-like structures, giving them the woolly appearance their scientific name alludes to.\n\nThe flowers are usually small and grouped together in dense, rounded or dome-shaped cluster called a capitulum, which sits atop the stalk. Although the individual flowers are tiny, when grouped together in the capitulum, they can create an attractive display. In some species, the flowers can exhibit subtle shades of color, such as white, pale pink, or gray, but they are not as vibrantly colorful as insect-pollinated flowers.\n\nThe differences between the various eriocaulon species can be subtle and are often related to variations in the shape, size, and color of their leaves, stalks, and flower heads. Some species may have more erect stems, while others have a tendency to sprawl. The variation in leaf structure can also be observed; for example, some species have flat, linear leaves, while others have cylindrical or needle-like leaves.\n\nThe flower head size can vary significantly across species, with some species like e. Giganticum featuring large flower heads, and others like e. Nanum showcasing smaller ones. The hair-like structures on the stems and the appearance of the bracts (modified leaves beneath the capitulum) can also differ among species, sometimes providing species-specific identification features.\n\nOverall, while the general appearance of eriocaulon species remains similar, one can find a range of variations in size, structure, and subtle color differences, reflecting the diversity within this genus. \n\n<user> It's great to know about the various appearances of eriocaulon species. i want more specific information about some of the species that can be found in different regions like australia, europe, the united states, and asia. can you give me detailed examples? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Here's a brief overview of selected eriocaulon species from different regions:\n\n1. Australia: eriocaulon aloefolium is found in queensland, while e. Australe can be found in regions of cambodia, china, malaysia, thailand, vietnam, the northern territory, queensland, new south wales, and even the pacific islands.\n\n2. Europe: eriocaulon aquaticum is the only species found in europe and can be seen along the atlantic ocean coasts of scotland and ireland. This species also occurs in eastern north america.\n\n3. United states: among the roughly 10 species found in the us, eriocaulon decangulare and eriocaulon ravenelii are native to the southern states.\n\n4. Asia: several species are distributed throughout asia, such as eriocaulon setaceum found in bangladesh, cambodia, china, india, indonesia, japan, laos, myanmar, sri lanka, thailand, vietnam, western australia, northern territory, and queensland.\n\nThese species are just a few examples, and there is a diverse array of eriocaulon species spread around various regions. \n\n<user> Do any eriocaulon species have any known uses or applications in traditional medicine or other industries? \n\n<assistant> While eriocaulon species are known primarily for their ecological roles and ornamental value, some species have been documented for having traditional medicinal uses or applications in specific cultural contexts.\n\nFor example, in traditional indian medicine (ayurveda), eriocaulon cinereum is used to treat various ailments. It is known for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antioxidant properties. The plant has been used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and gout. Its extracts have also been studied for their potential antimicrobial and anticancer activities.\n\nIn traditional chinese medicine, eriocaulon buergerianum is used for its diuretic and antipyretic properties. It has been used to treat conditions like urinary infections, nephritis, and edema.\n\nIt's crucial to note that while some eriocaulon species have been utilized in traditional medicine, research on their efficacy and safety is still limited. Therefore, it's essential to approach these applications with caution and rely on evidence-based therapies when treating health conditions.\n\nOutside of medicinal uses, some eriocaulon species are cultivated as ornamental plants in aquatic or bog garden settings. They can add visual interest, texture, and color to these types of gardens.\n\nIn summary, although eriocaulon species are not commonly utilized in mainstream medicine or industries, some have found applications in traditional medicine systems and as ornamental plants. It is important to emphasize that more research is needed to confirm their potential benefits and establish their safety and efficacy for various uses. Meanwhile, it's a good practice to rely on evidence-based treatments and consult with healthcare professionals when dealing with health issues. ",

They mark the lunchboxes with abbreviations for collection points, color codes for starting stations, numbers for destination stations, and markings for handling dabbawalas at the destination building and floor. \n\nThough they might have limited literacy, the dabbawalas are well-versed in recognizing symbols and colors. After collecting the lunchboxes, they bring them to a sorting place where the dabbas are grouped according to their destined locations. These groups of lunchboxes are then placed in specific coaches of trains with markings that identify their destination. Once the lunchboxes reach their respective stations, local dabbawalas take over and deliver them to the right recipients. The empty lunchboxes are later collected and returned to the originating locations.\n\nThroughout this entire process, the impressive teamwork and coordination among the dabbawalas, coupled with their time-tested organizational system, ensure that the lunchboxes are delivered accurately and on time. \n\n<user> It seems like a lot of intricate manual work goes into the functioning of the dabbawala system. how has the profession evolved over time? have any changes been made due to advancements in technology? \n\n<assistant> The dabbawala system has its roots in the late 1800s and has indeed evolved over time, although the core components of their work have remained largely unchanged.

The dabbawalas, however, continue to be a symbol of mumbai's resilience and adaptability. \n\n<user> How do dabbawalas handle different dietary preferences and restrictions, considering the diverse backgrounds of their customers? \n\n<assistant> Dabbawalas primarily act as a delivery service that transports lunchboxes from homes or restaurants to people at work. This means that the responsibility of preparing meals that cater to specific dietary preferences and restrictions falls on the customers or their families. The dabbawalas' main task is to ensure that the lunchboxes are accurately delivered to the intended recipient.\n\nHowever, the color-coding system used by dabbawalas does allow them to recognize potential dietary preferences and restrictions. Certain symbols or colors on the lunchboxes might indicate the type of meal contained within, making it easier for the dabbawalas to handle and deliver the tiffins without mixing them up. \n\nOverall, the dabbawala system effectively manages to transport a diverse range of meals without any significant complications, adapting to the varied tastes and preferences of its clientele. \n\n<user> That's so interesting! how do they split their earnings, and are there any penalties for breaking rules? \n\n<assistant> The dabbawalas work within a well-organized system that includes a fair distribution of earnings as well as penalties for breaking the rules. Each dabbawala is required to contribute a minimum capital in kind, such as two bicycles, a wooden crate for tiffins, white cotton kurta-pyjamas, and a white gandhi cap. \n\nAt the end of each month, the earnings of each unit are divided among the dabbawalas. There are penalties in place to maintain discipline and professionalism among the members. Fines can be imposed for consuming alcohol or tobacco while on duty, being out of uniform, or being absent from work without prior notice.\n\nThis disciplined approach ensures that the members follow a specific code of conduct, which in turn helps to maintain the high level of efficiency and reliability that the dabbawala system is known for.

        "reference": "The dabbawalas (also spelled dabbawallas or dabbawallahs, called tiffin wallahs in older sources) constitute a lunchbox delivery and return system that delivers hot lunches from homes and restaurants to people at work in India, especially in Mumbai. The lunchboxes are picked up in the late morning, delivered predominantly using bicycles and railway trains, and returned empty in the afternoon.\n\nOrigins \nIn the late 1800s, an increasing number of migrants were moving to Bombay from different parts of the country, and fast food and canteens were not prevalent. All these people left early in the morning for offices, and often had to go hungry for lunch. They belonged to different communities, and therefore had different types of tastes, which could only be satisfied by their own home-cooked meals. So, in 1890, Mahadeo Havaji Bachche started a lunch delivery service in Bombay with about a hundred men. This proved to be successful, and the service grew from there. In 1930, he informally attempted to unionize the dabbawalas. Later, a charitable trust was registered in 1956 under the name of Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Trust. The commercial arm of this trust was registered in 1968 as Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Association.\n\nEtymology \nWhen literally translated, the word \"dabbawala\" means \"one who carries a box\". \"Dabba\" means a box (usually a cylindrical tin or aluminium container) from , while \"wala\" is an agentive suffix, denoting a doer or holder of the preceding word. An English translation would be \"tiffin box delivery man\".\n\nColour-coding system\n\nLunch boxes are marked in several ways:\n Abbreviations for collection points\n Colour code for starting station\n Number for destination station\n Markings for handling dabbawala at destination, building and floor\n\nA colour-coding system identifies the destination and recipient. Each dabbawala is required to contribute a minimum capital in kind, in the form of two bicycles, a wooden crate for the tiffins, white cotton kurta-pyjamas, and the white Gandhi cap (topi). Each month there is a division of the earnings of each unit. Fines are imposed for alcohol, tobacco, being out of uniform, and absenteeism.\n\nA collecting dabbawala, usually on bicycle, collects dabbas either from a worker's home or from the dabba makers. As many of the carriers are of limited literacy (the average literacy of Dabbawallahs is that of 8th grade), the dabbas (boxes) have some sort of distinguishing mark on them, such as a colour or group of symbols.\n\nThe dabbawala then takes them to a sorting place, where he and other collecting dabbawalas sort the lunch boxes into groups. The grouped boxes are put in the coaches of trains, with markings to identify the destination of the box (usually there is a designated car for the boxes). The markings include the railway station to unload the boxes and the destination building delivery address. Some modern infrastructure improvements such as the Navi Mumbai Metro are not used in the supply chain, as cabins do not have the capacity for hundreds of tiffins.\n\nAt each station, boxes are handed over to a local dabbawala, who delivers them. The empty boxes are collected after lunch or the next day and sent back to the respective houses. The dabbawalas also allow for delivery requests through SMS.\n\nEthnicity\n\nMost tiffin-wallahs are related to each other, belong to the Varkari sect of Maharashtra, and come from the same small village near Pune. Tiffin distribution is suspended for five days each March as the tiffin-wallahs go home for the annual village festival.\n\nDabbawallahs have traditionally been male, but as of 2013, a few women had begun joining the profession. A dabbawallah can be either a foreman, mukadam, or a simple delivery man, gaddi. Typically, they begin between the ages of 15 and 20. While they take pride in their freedom and the fact that they work in a network of their relatives, the relatively low compensation provided for their physical exertion makes them discourage their own children from joining the profession.\n\nIn a typical day, a dabbawallah picks up tiffins every morning and then sorts them once before they are loaded onto the morning train (at approximately 10a.m.). The tiffins are sorted another time in the luggage compartment of the train. At the destination station, the tiffins are loaded into carts and deposited in stacks at the entrances of the various workplaces. Following lunch, the same procedure is carried out in the reverse order with the empty tiffins.\n\nAssociation \nThe earliest meetings of the Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Association were held in the open air. They took up premises in 1943 and settled the headquarters at Dadar in 1962. Located on the first floor of a building, the premises consist of a large, simply furnished room. A large mirrored painting of Saint Dnyaneshwar with Vithoba adorns one corner. Other portraits adorning the room include those of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and the founder of the association, Mahadeo Havaji Bachche.",

It also serves as a military highway to connect Fort Bliss in El Paso to Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo, New Mexico (via U.S. Route 70). The speed limit is 70 mph on the divided highway section upon entering the state to approximately  south of Alamogordo, with a 35 mph zone in Orogrande.  Upon entering Alamogordo, US 54 becomes concurrent with U.S. Route 70. US 54/US 70 then intersects the beginning of U.S. Route 82 at the north end of Alamogordo (near La Luz). The limit is 60 mph from Alamogordo to Tularosa and 55 mph north of Tularosa, where the concurrency with US 70 ends, and the highway reverts to being two lanes wide and not divided. The highway runs north through the central portion of the state, passing through Carrizozo and intersecting U.S. Route 380. The route then turns northeast before passing through Vaughn.  Upon entering Vaughn, the route is briefly concurrent with U.S. Route 60 and U.S. Route 285.  In Vaughn, US 285 splits off to the south.  Exiting Vaughn, US 60 splits off to the southeast, and the route continues northeast to Santa Rosa where it becomes concurrent with Interstate 40. The I-40 concurrency lasts for  to Tucumcari. The highway then exits the state back into Texas at Nara Visa. The highway runs for  in New Mexico, and is signed as a north–south route through the state.\n\nTexas (Panhandle) \n\nThe highway re-enters the Texas Panhandle just beyond Nara Visa, New Mexico, and continues northeast for  to the Oklahoma border. Major Texas cities along US 54 in the panhandle are Dalhart and Stratford.\n\nOklahoma \nUS-54 runs through the Oklahoma Panhandle from southwest to northeast.  It enters at Texhoma,  then continues northeast through Goodwell before entering Guymon.  In Guymon, it intersects US-412 and begins a concurrency with US-64.  It goes northeast through Optima and Hooker, where US-64 turns east.  After going northeast through Tyrone, it enters Kansas just before entering Liberal, Kansas.\n\nKansas \n\nUS 54 enters the state from Oklahoma in Seward County, and travels through the cities of Liberal and Plains, where it runs concurrently with US 160 in Meade County. Just east of the city of Meade, US 54 splits from US 160 and continues in a northeasterly direction through Meade and Ford counties before beginning a long concurrency with US 400 in Mullinville in Kiowa County.\n\nThe highway then travels through the town of Greensburg and continues as a two-lane road through Pratt, Cunningham, and Kingman. At Pratt, the Union Pacific railroad tracks which paralleled the highway for over  from El Paso turn to the northeast (towards Topeka) and leave US 54. The road becomes a divided highway in eastern Kingman County. From Kingman to Garden Plain in Sedgwick County it is a freeway but becomes an at-grade expressway as it passes through Goddard and approaches Wichita.\n\nThe freeway resumes as the road crosses the city limits of Wichita near Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport. In Wichita, US 54/US 400 is known as Kellogg Avenue, and has junctions with I-235, I-135 and I-35, the Kansas Turnpike, before a junction with K-96.",

It has a long history that dates back to 1920 when pennsylvania power & light (pp&l) was established through the merger of eight smaller pennsylvania utilities. Over the years, pp&l extended its service territory, eventually stretching from lancaster through the lehigh valley to scranton and wilkes-barre.\n\nThe company initially limited its operations to pennsylvania, but during the 1990s, deregulation of electrical utilities encouraged ppl to expand and acquire assets in other states. In 1995, the company was reorganized as a holding company called pp&l resources, which was later renamed ppl corporation in 2000.\n\nOne of ppl's significant acquisitions occurred in 1998 when they purchased 13 plants from montana power, adding over 2,500 mw of capacity which marked the biggest expansion in ppl's history. The hydroelectric facilities were eventually sold to northwestern in 2014.\n\nA series of acquisitions followed, including two regulated utilities in kentucky (louisville gas and electric and kentucky utilities) in 2010, and two regulated regional electricity distribution companies in the united kingdom in 2011. These uk companies, along with two others already acquired, operate under the name western power distribution (wpd).\n\nIn 2014, ppl divested its electrical generation facilities to a newly formed company called talen energy, allowing ppl to focus on transmission and distribution aspects of the electric utility business. On june 1, 2015, the talen spinoff was completed.\n\nIn 2020, ppl began the process of selling wpd to become a purely u.s.-focused energy company. The sale of wpd to national grid plc was completed on june 14, 2021 for £7.8 billion. Ppl also acquired national grid's rhode island electric and gas utility, the narragansett electric company, for $3.8 billion. \n\n<user> What are some notable subsidiaries of ppl corporation? \n\n<assistant> Ppl corporation has several notable subsidiaries operating in the energy sector. Some of them are:\n\n1. Ppl electric utilities corporation (also known as ppl electric utilities and formerly as pennsylvania power & light company or pennsylvania power & light): this is ppl's core subsidiary responsible for electricity distribution and customer services in the state of pennsylvania.\n\n2. Lg&e and ku energy: this is the parent company of louisville gas and electric and kentucky utilities.\n\n3. Louisville gas and electric (lg&e): a regulated utility providing natural gas and electricity services in kentucky.\n\n4. Kentucky utilities (ku): another regulated utility offering electricity services in kentucky and virginia.\n\n5. Ppl global: this subsidiary focuses on ppl's international investments and initiatives.\n\n6. Safari energy: a commercial solar energy provider acquired by ppl in 2018, focusing on the development and operation of solar projects for commercial customers.\n\nThese subsidiaries work together to provide energy services across the united states and contribute to ppl's overall growth and success. \n\n<user> Ppl corporation seems to have a good reputation for customer satisfaction. what are some examples of their achievements in this area? and can you also tell me about their headquarters, the ppl building? \n\n<assistant> You're right, ppl corporation has an impressive track record in customer satisfaction. Their subsidiaries have received multiple awards from j.d. Power and associates. Ppl electric utilities, which serves 1.4 million customers in 29 counties in pennsylvania, has received 30 j.d. Power awards for customer satisfaction. Louisville gas and electric and kentucky utilities, serving 1.3 million customers across kentucky and virginia, have secured 28 j.d. Power awards for customer satisfaction. These achievements demonstrate ppl's dedication to providing excellent service and support to their customers.\n\nRegarding their headquarters, the ppl building, it is located in allentown, pennsylvania, at the intersection of hamilton and ninth streets. Standing  tall with 23 stories, it became the tallest building in the greater lehigh valley after the demolition of the martin tower in 2019.

Through these investments, ppl seeks to better serve their customers and facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources, while also upgrading their own facilities.\n\nOne significant investment announced by ppl's former chairman and ceo, william spence, was a commitment of around $15 billion through 2022 for infrastructure and technology improvements. These efforts aim to modernize ppl's operations and enhance services for customers, while also making the energy grid more resilient to environmental changes and other challenges.\n\nAn example of ppl's investments is their $470 million project completed in the third quarter of 2019, in which they replaced traditional meters with \"advanced\" meters in pennsylvania. Such upgrades enable ppl to deliver real-time usage data to customers, helping them monitor and manage their energy consumption more effectively.\n\nThese initiatives underline ppl corporation's commitment to advancing clean energy technologies, as well as to providing reliable services, reducing environmental impacts, and contributing to a more sustainable future in the energy sector.

        "reference": "PPL Corporation is an energy company headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, United States. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nHistory\nPennsylvania Power & Light was founded in 1920 out of a merger of eight smaller Pennsylvania utilities. It gradually extended its service territory to a crescent-shaped region of central and northeastern Pennsylvania stretching from Lancaster through the Lehigh Valley into Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. In 1995, it reorganized as a holding company, PP&L Resources, which changed its name to its current name, PPL Corporation, in 2000.\n\nThe company limited its activities to Pennsylvania until deregulation of electrical utilities in the 1990s encouraged PPL to purchase assets in other states.  The largest of these transactions was PPL's 1998 purchase of 13 plants from Montana Power (leaving NorthWestern Energy – the buyer of the former Montana Power transmission and distribution systems – vulnerable to high \"spot\" prices on the energy market). This added over 2,500 MW of capacity and was the largest expansion in PPL's history. In 2014, those hydroelectric facilities were sold to NorthWestern.\n\nIn 2010, PPL completed the acquisition of two regulated utilities in Kentucky: Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities.\n\nIn 2011, PPL completed the acquisition of two regulated regional electricity distribution companies in the United Kingdom. Together, with two previously acquired regional electricity distribution companies, they operate under the name Western Power Distribution (WPD). \n\nOn June 6, 2014, PPL announced it would divest its electrical generation facilities to a newly formed company, Talen Energy.  On June 1, 2015, the Talen spinoff was completed, allowing PPL to concentrate on the transmission and distribution aspects of the electric utility business.\n\nIn 2020, PPL initiated a formal process to sell WPD in order to position PPL as a purely U.S.-focused energy company and create additional shareowner value. This resulted in a March 18, 2021, announcement of agreements to sell WPD to National Grid plc for £7.8 billion and acquire National Grid's Rhode Island electric and gas utility, the Narragansett Electric Company, for $3.8 billion. The sale of WPD was completed on June 14, 2021.\n\nSubsidiaries\nPPL Electric Utilities Corporation (commonly known as PPL Electric Utilities and formerly known as Pennsylvania Power & Light Company or Pennsylvania Power & Light)\nLG&E and KU Energy\nLouisville Gas and Electric\nKentucky Utilities\nPPL Global\nSafari Energy\n\nCustomer satisfaction\nPPL's companies regularly rank high in customer satisfaction studies. PPL Electric Utilities, which serves 1.4 million customers in 29 counties in Pennsylvania, has received 30 J.D. Power and Associates awards for customer satisfaction.\n\nLouisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, which serve 1.3 million customers in almost 100 counties across Kentucky and Virginia, have won 28 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction.\n\nHeadquarters\n\nPPL Building\n\nThe PPL Building is now the tallest building in not just Allentown, but in the greater Lehigh Valley, after the demolition of the Martin Tower on May 19, 2019.  The building has 23 stories and is  tall.  It is located at the intersection of Hamilton and Ninth Streets in the downtown area of the city.\n\nInvestments\nIn a speech before the Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference in November 2019, William Spence, PPL's former chairman and chief executive officer, said that the company is focusing on building more advanced cleaner energy technologies and is also increasing its effort on a strategy known as \"Energy Forward.\" The company is investing around $15 billion through 2022 to improve infrastructure and technology in order to \"create a smarter, more reliable and resilient energy grid,\" according to Spence. In the third quarter of 2019, PPL completed a $470 million investment in replacing meters with \"advanced\" meters in Pennsylvania.\n\nMarketing\nIn February 2010, PPL Corporation purchased the naming rights to the venue originally known as PPL Park in Chester, Pennsylvania (which is outside of PPL's service territory), the home stadium of Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union.  As part of the $25 million, 11-year deal, PPL EnergyPlus provides sustainable energy to PPL Park derived from other sources in Pennsylvania. After PPL spun off its non-regulated generation business into the separate Talen Energy, the stadium naming rights were assumed by the spinoff company and the venue became known as Talen Energy Stadium. In February 2020, the park was named Subaru Park.\n\nPPL owns the naming rights to the PPL Center in Allentown, which hosts the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League starting with the 2014 season. PPL paid an undisclosed sum over ten years.\n\nIn popular culture\nExterior shots of the building were used in the 1954 motion picture Executive Suite.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I admire Paul Robinson for his climbing achievements. Can you tell me more about his most notable climbing feats and competition results? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Paul robinson is an accomplished professional rock climber, specializing in bouldering. He has established and repeated several v15 bouldering problems in places like hueco tanks, the buttermilks, and magic wood.\n\nIn competition, robinson has an impressive track record. In 2007, he took second place at the 8th annual american bouldering series (abs) national championships, and won the event in 2008. He also placed third at the 2008 ifsc bouldering world cup in vail, colorado. Over the years, he continued to excel, with placings such as second at the 2009 abs national championships, fourth at the 2009 ifsc bouldering world cup in vail, third in the 2013 dark horse series iv, and sixth in the 2013 ifsc bouldering world cup in vail.\n\nAmong robinson's notable climbs are the third ascent of jade (v14) in rocky mountain national park in 2007, the flash of the v13 nagual boulder, the second ascent of terremer (v15) in hueco tanks in 2008, and the first ascent of lucid dreaming (proposed v16, later v15) in the buttermilks in 2010. He spent the summer of 2010 in rocklands, south africa, where he achieved the second ascent of monkey wedding, a v15 problem, and numerous other achievements. In 2011, he took the third ascent of trip hop (v15) and claimed two v15 second ascents in europe. In 2012, he established meadowlark lemon (v14) and claimed the second ascent of paint it black (v15). \n\n<user> What's the significance of flashing a v13 boulder problem? \n\n<assistant> Flashing a boulder problem means completing it on the first attempt without having tried the problem or seen someone else climb it before. The term \"flash\" signifies that the climber has been able to understand the problem's sequence and execute it flawlessly on the first try. Flashing a v13 boulder problem is especially significant because v13 is considered to be an extremely difficult grade, reserved for elite climbers. \n\nWhen paul robinson flashed the v13 nagual boulder, it demonstrated his remarkable skill, strength, and problem-solving capabilities. Achieving a flash at such a high difficulty level is a rare accomplishment. At the time, robinson was only the second person ever to have flashed a v13 boulder problem, after james pearson. This accomplishment further solidifies his status as one of the top boulderers in the world. \n\n<user> How does the lucid dreaming problem in the buttermilks compare to other problems of a similar grade that he's climbed? \n\n<assistant> Lucid dreaming is a highball bouldering problem in the buttermilks, located near bishop, california. When paul robinson first climbed it in 2010, he proposed a grade of v16, which would have been the highest grade assigned to any bouldering problem at that time. However, he later suggested that lucid dreaming might be a v15 instead.\n\nThe boulder itself is about 50 feet from ground to top, with a steep overhang at the beginning and a slab traversal towards the end. The primary challenge of lucid dreaming lies in the two consecutive v12 moves near the start, both featuring small, technical holds. This makes it different from other v15 problems that robinson has climbed, as the crux of the difficulty is concentrated in a few powerful moves.\n\nIn comparison, other v15 problems he has climbed, like terremer in hueco tanks or monkey wedding in rocklands, may have diverse and sustained challenges throughout the problem. The uniqueness of each climb ultimately depends on factors such as holds, climbing style, and route sequence. While lucid dreaming stands out for its concentrated challenges, each v15 problem has its distinct characteristics that test the climber's capabilities in different ways. \n\n<user> How does paul robinson's accomplishments measure up against other famous climbers like chris sharma and daniel woods? \n\n<assistant> Paul robinson, chris sharma, and daniel woods are all highly accomplished climbers with impressive records. While their achievements are distinct, comparisons can be made to better understand their individual accomplishments.\n\nPaul robinson is renowned for his prowess in bouldering, having established and repeated several v15 bouldering problems. His flashes, onsights, and competition performances showcase his remarkable skill in the sport. In particular, his one-attempt flash of the v13 nagual boulder stands out as a major accomplishment.\n\nChris sharma is often considered one of the best rock climbers in the world. His achievements span both sport climbing and bouldering, with numerous first ascents of routes rated 5.15 and high-grade bouldering problems. His iconic climbs include \"jumbo love,\" the first-ever 5.15b route, and \"es pontas,\" a deep-water solo climb in mallorca. While sharma has a broader focus across different climbing disciplines, his impact and legacy in the sport are undeniable.\n\nDaniel woods is another accomplished boulderer with multiple v15 and v16 problems under his belt. His accomplishments include establishing \"the process,\" a v16 in bishop, california, and the first ascent of \"hypnotized minds\" (v16) in rocky mountain national park. In competition, he has claimed multiple abs national championships and consistently ranked highly in the ifsc world cup events.\n\nAll three of these climbers have made significant contributions to the sport of climbing, continually pushing the limits and inspiring others. Their accomplishments, while impressive in their own right, are part of a broader, growing community of climbers seeking to redefine what is possible in the sport. ",

        "reference": "Paul David Robinson (born August 28, 1987) is an American professional rock climber who specializes in bouldering. He has established and repeated several bouldering problems at the V15 difficulty rating, in such areas as Hueco Tanks, the Buttermilks, and Magic Wood. In 2007, Robinson became the second climber in history to successfully climb a V13 boulder problem in one attempt.\n\nCompetitions \nIn 2007, Paul Robinson took second place at the 8th Annual American Bouldering Series (ABS) National Championships. The following year, Robinson took first place at the competition, beating Chris Sharma and Sean McColl. Later that year, he took third place at the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) Bouldering World Cup in Vail, Colorado. In 2009, Robinson competed once again in the ABS National Championships, this time taking second place behind Daniel Woods. At the IFSC Bouldering World Cup in Vail, he completed three of the four finals problems, placing him in fourth behind Kilian Fischhuber. In January 2013, Robinson took third place in the finals of the Dark Horse Series IV bouldering competition. The following June, Robinson reached the finals of the IFSC Bouldering World Cup in Vail, but was unable to finish any of the final boulders and took sixth place.\n\nNotable ascents \n\nIn August 2007, Robinson made the third ascent of Jade, a V14 bouldering problem in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Later that year, he climbed the V13 Nagual boulder in one attempt, an accomplishment known as a \"flash\". This made Robinson the second person to have flashed a V13, after James Pearson. The following January, Robinson claimed the second ascent of Terremer, a V15 boulder in Hueco Tanks, Texas. The problem was established by Swiss climber Fred Nicole two years earlier. At the time, it was regarded as the most challenging problem at Hueco Tanks, and Robinson described it as \"the hardest boulder I have ever done so far.\"\n\nOn 30 March 2010, Robinson claimed the first ascent of Lucid Dreaming, a highball bouldering problem in the Buttermilks near Bishop, California. He originally proposed a grade of V16, the highest bouldering grade that had yet been assigned to a problem, but he later suggested Lucid Dreaming might be a V15. The boulder is  from ground to top, beginning with a steep overhang and ending with a slab traversal. Much of the difficulty of the climb comes from two consecutive V12 moves near the beginning, both featuring small, technical holds. The problem was not repeated until January 2014.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, Robinson spent two months climbing in Rocklands, South Africa. His main project was the second ascent of Monkey Wedding, a V15 boulder problem first established in 2002 by Fred Nicole. Other achievements included a flash of The Amphitheater (V12), and two V14 first ascents: The Big Short and Black Eagle. Later that year, Robinson visited Magic Wood in Switzerland, where he established Il Trill, a boulder problem rated 8c on the Fontainebleau scale.\n\nIn February 2011, Robinson took the third ascent of Trip Hop, a V15 problem established by Sébastien Frigault in 2003. The following month, he claimed two V15 second ascents in Europe: The Story of Two Worlds, established in 2005 by Dave Graham, and Angama, established in 2006 by Dai Koyamada. In January 2012, Robinson established Meadowlark Lemon, a V14 sit-start variation of the V13 Meadowlark problem in Red Rock Canyon, Nevada. Later that year, he claimed the second ascent of Paint it Black, a V15 problem established in Rocky Mountain National Park by Daniel Woods.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n IFSC Profile\n 27 Crags Profile\n Interview with Paul Robinson\n\nSee also\n Notable first free ascents\n\nAmerican rock climbers\nLiving people\n1987 births",

They were a tribal confederation of iron age semitic-speaking tribes that inhabited a part of the arab world. These tribes trace their lineage back to ishmael, who according to religious texts was the first son of abraham and his egyptian wife, hagar.\n\nIn the abrahamic religions, ishmael is considered a prophet in the quran and an important figure in biblical texts. His twelve sons, known as the \"twelve princes,\" are associated with the rise of the twelve tribes of ishmael in islamic tradition. The twelve tribes of israel, on the other hand, trace their ancestry back to isaac, abraham's other son with his first wife, sarah.\n\nThese connections between the ishmaelites, abraham, and the abrahamic religions are significant because they tie the different faiths together through shared history and genealogy. Although there is no archaeological evidence to support the biblical accounts as historical fact, these stories still hold great meaning for people who follow these faiths. \n\n<user> Ishmael's life? \n\n<assistant> Ishmael's life story is found in both the hebrew bible and the islamic holy book, the quran. In the hebrew bible, specifically in the book of genesis, abraham's first wife sarah could not conceive, so she decided to give her egyptian slave, hagar, to abraham so he might have an heir. Hagar conceived ishmael, making him the first son of abraham.\n\nIshmael and his mother, hagar, faced many challenges. When sarah finally gave birth to isaac, tensions between sarah and hagar rose. Sarah demanded that abraham send hagar and ishmael away, and he complied. God, however, reassured abraham that he would take care of hagar and ishmael, and that ishmael would grow up to be the father of a great nation (the ishmaelites).\n\nIn the quran, the story of ishmael (known as ismail) is similar. He played a crucial role in the foundation of kaaba in mecca alongside his father, abraham (known as ibrahim). When god ordered abraham to take ishmael and hagar to present-day mecca, he then asked abraham to perform a special prayer for their protection and wellbeing.\n\nDespite the differences in detail, both the hebrew bible and the quran consider ishmael a significant figure who was under god's blessing and protection. His legacy continued as his descendants formed important tribes in the ancient arab world, influencing and shaping the development of the abrahamic religions. \n\n<user> How do these religious stories and beliefs impact modern day followers of Abrahamic religions and their understanding of each other? \n\n<assistant> The religious stories and beliefs surrounding ishmael and the ishmaelites hold a significant place in the abrahamic faiths, as they provide a shared genealogy and history. This common heritage can foster connections and understanding among the followers of judaism, christianity, and islam.\n\nThe stories of ishmael, abraham, and their descendants are seen as a way to emphasize the shared roots and values of these faiths. By recognizing this common ground, believers from different abrahamic religions may better appreciate one another's traditions, leading to more peaceful coexistence, understanding, and dialogue.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these stories can also be interpreted differently across the faiths, which can result in theological disagreements and tension. Nevertheless, understanding and acknowledging the shared aspects of these stories can serve as a starting point for constructive dialogue and maintaining respect among religious communities.\n\nWhile the ancient stories of ishmael and the ishmaelites might not always directly impact the daily lives of modern followers, they remain a vital part of the cultural and religious narrative for each faith, shaping the way people view their own history and their relationship with other abrahamic faiths.

According to Genesis, Ishmael had one daughter and twelve sons, the \"twelve princes\" mentioned in Genesis 17:20. In Islamic tradition, these gave rise to the \"Twelve Tribes of Ishmael\", Arab tribes from which the early Muslims were descended. In Jewish tradition, the Twelve Tribes of Israel were descended from Abraham's other son, Isaac, via Isaac's son Jacob. This traditions are accepted by both Islam and Judaism.\n\nGenesis and 1 Chronicles describe the Qedarites as a tribe descended from the second son of Ishmael, Qedar. Some Abrahamic scholars described the historic tribe of Nabataeans as descendants of Nebaioth based on the similarity of sounds, but others reject this connection. Different Islamic groups assign the ancestry of the prophet Muhammad either to Qedar or Nebaioth.\n\nThere is no archaeological evidence to support the belief that the patriarchs and matriarchs of Genesis were historic people, and most scholars do not consider scriptural accounts to be accurate accounts of early history.\n\nAssyrian and Babylonian Inscriptions refer to the Ishmaelites as \"Sumu'ilu\", a tribal confederation that would take control of the incense trade route during the dominance of the Assyrian Empire to the north.\n\nJewish narrative\n\nHebrew Bible \n\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, Abraham's first wife was named Sarah and her Egyptian slave was named Hagar. However, Sarah could not conceive. In chapter 16, Sarah (then Sarai) gave her slave Hagar in marriage to Abraham, in order that Abraham might have an heir.\n\nHagar conceived Ishmael from Abraham, and the Ishmaelites descend from him.\nAfter Abraham pleaded with God for Ishmael to live under his blessing, chapter 17 states:\n\nChapter 25 lists his sons as:\n\nAccording to the documentary hypothesis, Genesis 25 would have been added during the Persian Period by the Priestly source, who attributed the known Ishmaelite (Shumu'ilu) Tribes as the names of the sons of Ishmael. However, the name and narrative of Ishmael found in other parts of Genesis would antedate this by centuries. The Hebrew Bible already contained the story of Ishmael, and it would later come across Ishmaelite Tribes, and they would invent names for Ishmael's sons, named after the various tribes in the Ishmaelite Confederacy.\n\nIslamic narrative\n\nQuran and hadiths \n\nThe Islamic holy book Quran states \"Allah has gifted all of Ismail, al-Yasa, Yunus and Lut a favor above the nations.\nWith some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren; and We chose them and guided them unto a straight path\". (Quran 6:86).\n\nThe Ishmaelite story begins when Abraham (Ibrahim) and Hagar (Hajar) bear the prophetic child, who was named Ishmael (Ismail) in the order of God (Allah) through one of his angels. God ordered Abraham to take his son Ishmael and wife Hagar to present-day Mecca. He prayed for them after leaving them, saying: \"O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivatable valley by Your Sacred House (the Kaaba ('Cube') at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Ṣalāt.",

South ronaldsay is one of the orkney islands off the north coast of scotland. It is connected to the orkney mainland by the churchill barriers, linking it with burray, glimps holm, and lamb holm. The island spans an area of 4,980 hectares and is the fourth largest island in orkney.\n\nSome noteworthy sites on the island include the neolithic isbister chambered cairn, commonly known as the \"tomb of the eagles.\" thousands of human and bird bones were discovered here, providing glimpses into ancient burial practices. Another interesting location is the bronze age burnt mound at liddle, which was used for cooking and is a prime example of such a structure in orkney.\n\nSouth ronaldsay's main village is st.

At this neolithic site, around 16,000 human bones and 725 bird bones were uncovered, most of which belonged to the white-tailed sea eagle (haliaeetus albicilla).\n\nResearchers believe that the human bodies were exposed to the elements to remove flesh before being placed in the tomb. This practice, called \"sky burial\" or \"excarnation,\" allowed scavengers, particularly birds, to clean the bones. The presence of a significant number of eagle bones suggests that these birds of prey played a role in this process. The tomb itself was in use for over a millennium, indicating the cultural significance of the site.\n\nThe tomb of the eagles provides valuable insights into neolithic burial customs and the relationship between humans and eagles in the orkney islands at the time. \n\n<user> Boys' ploughing match. what do they do in it? \n\n<assistant> The boys' ploughing match is a fun and unique annual event held in st.

        "reference": "South Ronaldsay () () is one of the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland. It is linked to the Orkney Mainland by the Churchill Barriers, running via Burray, Glimps Holm and Lamb Holm.\n\nName\nAlong with North Ronaldsay, the island is named after St Ronald. The original name from which the English name derives, Rǫgnvaldsey, comes from Old Norse; Rǫgnvalds (\"Ronald's\") + ey (\"island\").\n\nGeography and geology\nWith an area of , it is the fourth largest of the Orkney islands after The Mainland, Hoy and Sanday. Ferries sail from Burwick on the island to John o' Groats on the Scottish mainland and from St Margaret's Hope to Gills Bay.\n\nSouth Ronaldsay's main village is St Margaret's Hope, Orkney's third largest settlement. It is named either after Margaret, Maid of Norway, the heir to the Scottish throne who died in Orkney age seven or possibly St. Margaret.  The village has a small blacksmith's museum and is known for its annual Boys' Ploughing Match. During this event young girls and boys dressed in dark jackets play the part of the horses and young boys using miniature ploughs compete with one another at ploughing a 4-foot square rig in the nearby sands.\n\nThe cardinal points of the island are Ayre of Cara, by Churchill Barrier no. 4 (north), Grimness (east), Brough Ness, (south) and Hoxa Head, (west). The highest elevation is Ward Hill, which reaches . This name is common one in Orkney for the highest point on an island and comes from the  historic use of these places used for the lighting of warning beacons.\n\nPrehistory\n\nThe island is known for the Neolithic Isbister Chambered Cairn, popularly known as the \"Tomb of the Eagles\". Discovered by Ronald Simison in 1958 in the south east of the island, 16,000 human bones and 725 bird bones were found at the site, the latter predominantly belonging to the White-tailed Sea Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla). The evidence suggests that  the human bodies had been exposed to the elements to remove the flesh before burial. The tomb was in continuous use for a millennium or more.\n\nThe burnt mound at nearby Liddle, discovered by Simison in 1972, is the best example of a Bronze Age cooking place in Orkney. Made of flat slabs originally sealed with clay, the central stone trough would have been filled with water heated by stones using peat as a fuel. The building was probably roofless.\n\nThere is a broch site at Howe of Hoxa in the north west that may have been the burial place of Thorfinn \"Skullsplitter\".\n\nHistory\nIn 1627 nine chapels were recorded on the island with some of the names hinting at the existence of Christian worship prior to the Norse conquest of Orkney.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Session of christ? \n\n<assistant> The session of christ is a christian doctrine stating that jesus christ is seated at the right hand of god the father in heaven. The term \"session\" comes from an archaic noun meaning \"sitting.\" in the context of the session of christ, it refers to the act of sitting down and taking a specific place in heaven.\n\nThis doctrine holds significant theological importance as it is connected to the role of christ as king. It is one of the doctrines explicitly mentioned in the apostles' creed, which says that jesus christ \"sitteth on the right hand of god the father almighty\" immediately after ascending to heaven.\n\nVarious biblical references support this idea. In the book of acts (acts 2:33), after jesus' resurrection and ascension, he is described as being \"exalted to the right hand of god.\" this exaltation is seen as a fulfillment of psalm 110:1. Other passages that mention christ being at god's right hand include ephesians 1:20 and 1 peter 3:22.\n\nThe new testament also describes jesus standing and walking in heaven. However, these postures are not part of the session of christ doctrine. The act of sitting down signifies a position of authority and honor, making it crucial to understanding the role of jesus in the christian faith.\n\nThe session of christ is also mentioned in creeds: the apostles' creed, which includes the statement \"sitteth on the right hand of the father,\" and the niceno-constantinopolitan creed of 381, where it is retained in all english versions. \n\n<user> Can you further explain the posture part in the session of christ? \n\n<assistant> In the session of christ, the posture of sitting down is significant because it implies a position of authority, honor, and kingship. The right hand is considered a special place of honor in the bible, engaging the association of the right hand with power, authority, and righteousness.\n\nJesus sitting at the right hand of god the father symbolizes his status as king in the celestial realm. When seated, it represents that jesus has completed his mission on earth and has been given a place of authority at the father's side in heaven.\n\nAlthough sitting is primarily used to describe jesus' position in this context, the new testament also has instances where jesus is seen standing or walking in heaven. For example, in acts 7:55, stephen sees jesus standing at the right hand of god. This may signify that jesus rises momentarily to greet stephen, stands as a witness, or is preparing to return.\n\nIn the book of revelation (revelation 2:1), jesus is described as walking among seven golden lampstands, symbolizing his presence in the midst of the churches that the lampstands represent. In this case, the walking posture can be seen as an indication of jesus' continuous presence and active awareness of the activities of the churches.\n\nThe emphasis on jesus' seated posture in the session of christ doctrine highlights the importance of his divine authority and kingship, while standing or walking postures illustrate his continued involvement and presence among his followers. \n\n<user> What consequences does the session of christ have in christian life and beliefs? \n\n<assistant> The Session of Christ has profound implications for Christian life and beliefs, playing an essential role in shaping the understanding of Jesus' divine authority, his ongoing work as an advocate and mediator, and the nature of the church. Here are some consequences deriving from this doctrine:\n\n1. Affirmation of Christ's authority: The Session of Christ emphasizes that Jesus is the ultimate King and holds the highest place of honor and authority next to God the Father. This understanding leads Christians to acknowledge and submit to the sovereign rule of Christ over their lives.\n\n2. Jesus as advocate and mediator: The Session of Christ signifies that Jesus not only completed his mission on Earth but also continues to intercede for his followers before God. As seen in Hebrews 7:25, Jesus is considered the mediator between God and humanity, ensuring forgiveness, grace, and access to the divine presence.\n\n3. Assurance of salvation: With Jesus seated at the right hand of God, his followers receive assurance of their salvation, knowing that the sacrifice he made on the cross is sufficient and eternally effective. They can be confident in their faith and rest in the knowledge that their Redeemer is actively advocating for them.\n\n4. Empowerment of believers: Jesus' Session bestows the Holy Spirit, which empowers Christians to carry out their divine mission to live according to God's will and spread the gospel. Acts 2:33 points to Jesus sending the promised Holy Spirit after being exalted to the right hand of God.\n\n5. The nature of the church: The Session of Christ illuminates the church's nature as a kingdom with Christ as King. Christians are considered citizens of this heavenly kingdom, with an obligation to advance the Gospel and embody Christ's love and teachings on Earth.\n\nIn summary, the Session of Christ influences various aspects of Christian life and beliefs, highlighting Jesus' supreme authority, his role as mediator and advocate, the assurance of salvation for believers, the empowerment of the faithful through the Holy Spirit, and the nature of the church as a kingdom ruled by Christ.

It's used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency that can occur due to various reasons like pernicious anemia, surgical removal of the stomach, fish tapeworm, or bowel cancer. Although it is less preferred than hydroxocobalamin for treating vitamin B12 deficiency, it is still an effective option.\n\nCyanocobalamin can be taken by mouth, injected into a muscle, or used as a nasal spray. It is prescribed after surgery involving part or all of the stomach or intestine to ensure adequate serum levels of vitamin B12. It also treats pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency due to poor food intake, absorption issues, and other factors like thyrotoxicosis, hemorrhage, malignancy, liver disease, and kidney disease.\n\nInjections of cyanocobalamin may be prescribed to gastric bypass patients who have difficulty acquiring vitamin B12 due to having part of their small intestine bypassed. Additionally, cyanocobalamin is used to perform the Schilling test, which checks a person's ability to absorb vitamin B12.\n\nIt was first manufactured in the 1940s and is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In 2019, it was the 155th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. \n\n<user> In my younger days, I didn't know much about side effects. Now that I'm older, I would like to know what are some of the side effects of cyanocobalamin injection? And what precautions should I take if I need to use it for my vitamin B12 deficiency? \n\n<assistant> It's important to be aware of potential side effects when taking any medication. With cyanocobalamin injections, possible side effects include allergic reactions like hives, difficulty breathing, redness of the face, swelling of the arms, hands, feet, ankles or lower legs, extreme thirst, and diarrhea. Less-serious side effects may consist of headache, dizziness, leg pain, itching, or rash.\n\nWhen treating megaloblastic anemia with concurrent vitamin b12 deficiency, the use of cyanocobalamin can lead to hypokalemia (low blood potassium) due to increased erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) and consequent cellular uptake of potassium. For patients with leber's disease, cyanocobalamin treatment may result in serious optic atrophy, possibly leading to blindness.\n\nIf you need to use cyanocobalamin for your vitamin b12 deficiency, consult your doctor before starting the treatment.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I recently underwent a chest x-ray and the doctor found a small nodule in my lung. i'm a bit worried about what it could be and how it might affect my health. can you give me an overview of lung nodules and the possible causes? what factors might indicate whether it's benign or malignant? \n\n<assistant> A lung nodule, also known as a pulmonary nodule, is a small focal density in the lung. It's usually smaller than three centimeters in diameter, and may occur as a solitary pulmonary nodule (spn) or in multiples.\n\nIn most cases, lung nodules are benign and could represent a granuloma, hamartoma, or other non-cancerous growths. However, in about 20% of cases, they may represent malignant cancer, especially in older adults and smokers.\n\nSeveral factors can help in determining the nature of a lung nodule. These include size, location, margin morphology, presence of multiple nodules, growth rate, presence of emphysema or fibrosis, and characteristics observed in radiological imaging. It's important to follow up with your doctor and possibly conduct further tests to properly assess the nature of the nodule. \n\n<user> What are some common benign causes of lung nodules? i know you mentioned granuloma and hamartoma, but i'm curious if there are other possibilities as well. also, how do the risk factors for incidentally discovered nodules, like size and location, affect the probability of cancer? are there specific signs in radiological imaging that suggest a higher likelihood of malignancy in a pulmonary nodule? \n\n<assistant> Apart from granuloma and hamartoma, various benign causes of lung nodules include infections like tuberculosis, fungal infections (e.g., coccidioidomycosis), lung abscess, pneumonia, and rarer infections like nocardial infection or worm infestations. Immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and organizing pneumonia, can also lead to lung nodules.\n\nSome risk factors affecting the probability of a nodule being cancerous are:\n\n1. Size: larger nodules have a higher risk of cancer.\n2. Location: upper lobe location increases cancer risk, but proximity to fissures or pleura may indicate a benign cause.\n3. Margin morphology: spiculated margins are a risk factor for cancer.\n4. Multiplicity: up to 3 additional nodules increase cancer risk, but 4 or more decreases it.\n5. Growth rate: solid cancers have typical doubling times of 100-400 days while subsolid cancers take 3-5 years.\n6. Presence of emphysema or fibrosis: these are risk factors for cancer.\n\nIn radiological imaging, certain characteristics can suggest a higher likelihood of malignancy, such as spiculations (highly predictive of cancer), pleural retraction, irregular or lobulated margins, and thicker walls in the case of central cavities. However, these factors should be assessed by a medical professional alongside other clinical information to make an accurate determination. \n\n<user> Are there any treatment options or follow-up techniques to monitor lung nodules and help distinguish between benign and malignant growths? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are several follow-up techniques and treatment options that can help monitor lung nodules and differentiate between benign and malignant growths. The course of action primarily depends on the individual's risk factors and the characteristics of the lung nodule.\n\n1. Observation and monitoring: for low-risk patients with small nodules, periodic monitoring with chest x-rays or ct scans may be advised. This helps determine any changes in nodule size or appearance, which could indicate malignancy.\n\n2. Non-invasive imaging: contrast-enhanced ct scans or pet scans can assess factors like enhancement and metabolic activity, which can help differentiate between benign and malignant nodules.\n\n3. Biopsy: if there's a high suspicion of cancer, biopsy techniques such as fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (vats) may be performed to obtain tissue samples for analysis.\n\n4. Surgical resection: for nodules highly suggestive of malignancy or when biopsy is inconclusive, surgical removal may be considered to confirm the diagnosis and remove the potential cancer.\n\n5. Additional tests: blood tests and pulmonary function tests might also be conducted to better understand the individual's overall health and risk factors.\n\nIt's crucial to consult with your doctor to identify the most appropriate approach based on your specific findings and risk factors. They will guide you in determining the best course of action for monitoring and treating the lung nodule. \n\n<user> How common are incidentally discovered lung nodules on chest x-rays and ct scans? \n\n<assistant> Lung nodules are incidentally discovered in a fairly small percentage of chest x-rays and ct scans. One or more lung nodules can be an incidental finding in up to 0.2% of chest x-rays and around 1% of ct scans.\n\nThe higher sensitivity of ct scans compared to chest x-rays means they are more likely to detect small nodules that might otherwise remain unnoticed. However, the vast majority of these incidentally discovered nodules turn out to be benign, representing non-cancerous growths or other medical conditions.\n\nDespite the low incidence rate, it's important to adequately evaluate and follow up on incidentally discovered lung nodules, especially for those who have risk factors for lung cancer, such as a history of smoking, exposure to asbestos, or other carcinogens. Monitoring these nodules and addressing any suspicious findings with appropriate testing and interventions can help ensure early detection and treatment of lung cancer, if present, and can significantly improve the prognosis.\n\nIt is essential to discuss any concerns or findings with your doctor, who can interpret the radiological images and provide a professional assessment, taking into account your medical history, risk factors, and the appearance and characteristics of the nodules.

It's usually smaller than three centimeters in diameter, and may occur as a solitary pulmonary nodule (spn) or in multiples.\n\nIn most cases, lung nodules are benign and could represent a granuloma, hamartoma, or other non-cancerous growths. However, in about 20% of cases, they may represent malignant cancer, especially in older adults and smokers.\n\nSeveral factors can help in determining the nature of a lung nodule. These include size, location, margin morphology, presence of multiple nodules, growth rate, presence of emphysema or fibrosis, and characteristics observed in radiological imaging. It's important to follow up with your doctor and possibly conduct further tests to properly assess the nature of the nodule.",

        "reference": "A lung nodule or pulmonary nodule is a relatively small focal density in the lung. A solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) or coin lesion, is a mass in the lung smaller than three centimeters in diameter. A pulmonary micronodule has a diameter of less than three millimetres. There may also be multiple nodules.\n\nOne or more lung nodules can be an incidental finding found in up to 0.2% of chest X-rays and around 1% of CT scans.\n\nThe nodule most commonly represents a benign tumor such as a granuloma or hamartoma, but in around 20% of cases it represents a malignant cancer, especially in older adults and smokers. Conversely, 10 to 20% of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed in this way. If the patient has a history of smoking or the nodule is growing, the possibility of cancer may need to be excluded through further radiological studies and interventions, possibly including surgical resection. The prognosis depends on the underlying condition.\n\nCauses\nNot every round spot on a radiological image is a solitary pulmonary nodule: it may be confused with the projection of a structure of the chest wall or skin, such as a nipple, a healing rib fracture or electrocardiographic monitoring.\n\nThe most important cause to exclude is any form of lung cancer, including rare forms such as primary pulmonary lymphoma, carcinoid tumor and a solitary metastasis to the lung (common unrecognised primary tumor sites are melanomas, sarcomas or testicular cancer). Benign tumors in the lung include hamartomas and chondromas.\n\nThe most common benign coin lesion is a granuloma (inflammatory nodule), for example due to tuberculosis or a fungal infection, such as Coccidioidomycosis. Other infectious causes include a lung abscess, pneumonia (including pneumocystis pneumonia) or rarely nocardial infection or worm infection (such as dirofilariasis or dog heartworm infestation). Lung nodules can also occur in immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or organizing pneumonia.\n\nA solitary lung nodule can be found to be an arteriovenous malformation, a hematoma or an infarction zone. It may also be caused by bronchial atresia, sequestration, an inhaled foreign body or pleural plaque.\n\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for incidentally discovered nodules are mainly:\n General risk factors of lung cancer such as exposure to tobacco smoking or other carcinogens such as asbestos and previously diagnosed cancer, respiratory infections, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n Size: larger size confers a higher risk of cancer\n\n Location: Upper lobe location is a risk factor for cancer, while a location close to a fissure or the pleura indicates a benign lymph node, especially if having a triangular shape.\n Margin morphology: a spiculated margin is a risk factor for cancer. Benign causes tend to have a well defined border, whereas lobulated lesions or those with an irregular margin extending into the neighbouring tissue tend to be malignant. In particular, spiculations are highly predictive of malignancy with a positive predictive value up to 90%.  Also, a \"notch sign\", which is an abrupt indentation of the nodule, increases the risk of cancer, but may also be found in granulomatous diseases.\n\n Multiplicity: Where the presence of up to an additional 3 nodules has been found to increase the risk of cancer, but decrease in case of 4 or more additional ones, likely because it indicates a previous granulomatous infection rather than cancer.\n Growth rate: solid cancers generally doubles in volume over between 100 and 400 days, while subsolid cancers (generally representing adenocarcinomas) generally doubles in volume over 3 to 5 years. One volume doubling equals approximately a 26% increase in diameter.\n Presence of emphysema and/or fibrosis is a risk factor for cancer. In comparison, the typical size doubling are less than 20 days for infections, and more than 400 days for benign nodules.\n Enhancement: If the exam is done as a combined non-contrast and contrast CT, a solitary nodule with an enhancement off less than 15 Hounsfield units (HU), whereas a higher enhancement indicates a malignant tumor (with a sensitivity estimated at 98%).\n Areas of fatty tissue (−40 to −120 HU) indicates a hamartoma. However, only about 50% of hamartomas are fat containing.\n If there is a central cavity, then a thin wall points to a benign cause whereas a thick wall is associated with malignancy (especially 4 mm or less versus 16 mm or more).\n\n In case of calcifications, a popcorn-like appearance indicates a hamartoma, which is benign.\n In case of subsolid nodules, being part solid has a higher risk of cancer than being purely ground glass opacity.\n\n Pleural retraction is far more common in cancers.",

It aims to elevate the level of young professional soccer players in the united states by offering them opportunities to develop and be more prepared for professional soccer careers. Under this program, select young players sign contracts with mls and are made available in the superdraft. These players are considered generation adidas players and are usually highly regarded prospects.\n\nThe program provides benefits to both the league and the players. For mls, it ensures a continuous influx of top talent into the league, raising the overall skill level and competitiveness. For the players, they receive various benefits such as guaranteed scholarships to continue their education, salary above the league's minimum, and other performance-based incentives. Additionally, generation adidas players who enter the mls superdraft do not count against a team's salary budget, which makes them more attractive to teams during the draft process.\n\nIn the context of the 2009 mls superdraft, any player with an asterisk (*) next to their name was contracted under the generation adidas program.

Here's a summary of some trades involving 2009 supplemental draft selections:\n\n1. On august 15, 2007, the colorado rapids acquired a first-round selection in the 2009 supplemental draft, a fourth-round pick (#53) in the 2009 superdraft, and allocation money from the kansas city wizards in exchange for forward herculez gomez. This trade provided rapids with more options in the drafts while the wizards gained a productive forward.\n\n2. On september 14, 2007, the kansas city wizards acquired a first-round pick in the 2009 supplemental draft, a third-round pick (#42) in the 2009 superdraft, and a portion of a player allocation from real salt lake in exchange for forward yura movsisyan and a youth international roster spot. Wizards obtained additional draft picks, while real salt lake received an impactful forward and a valuable roster spot.\n\n3. On april 3, 2008, toronto fc acquired a first-round pick in the 2009 supplemental draft from d.c. United in exchange for defender mike zaher. This trade allowed toronto fc to strengthen their draft position while d.c. United received a needed defender.\n\nAs the supplemental draft was canceled in december 2008, it remains unknown what compensation, if any, the teams received in lieu of the draft picks. Despite the cancellation, these trades still highlighted the strategic maneuvers by the mls teams to bolster their rosters by acquiring or giving up key players or draft positions. ",

The japanese swimmer you're referring to is daiya seto. Seto is an accomplished professional swimmer who began taking up swimming at the age of five. His specialties are individual medley, butterfly, breaststroke, and freestyle events.\n\nIn 2012, seto burst onto the international scene after winning the gold medal in the 400-metre individual medley at the world short course championships. He set an asian record at that time as well. Following this, seto continued to excel in international competitions, winning gold in the same event at the short course world championships in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021.\n\nAt the long course world championships, seto won gold in the 400-metre individual medley in 2013, 2015, and 2019.

Seto took part in the 2020 summer olympics in tokyo, where he finished fourth in the 200-metre individual medley and didn't qualify for the 400-metre individual medley final. \n\n<user> It's impressive how he started swimming at such a young age. seto's early years? for example, his journey leading up to the 2012 japan olympic team selection and his performance in the 2012 fina swimming world cup. \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Daiya seto's passion for swimming began at the tender age of five. Although he showed great potential early on, he narrowly missed being part of the 2012 japan olympic team. He finished third in both the 200-metre and 400-metre individual medley events at the national selection meet, which ultimately cost him a spot on the team.\n\nHowever, seto didn't let that setback dissuade him. With determination, he sharpened his skills and improved his times at the 2012 fina swimming world cup. During the competition, he participated in all stops of the world cup circuit and achieved a commendable fourth-place finish across all stops. \n\nThis performance played a crucial role in seto's growth, as it provided him valuable experience and exposure to international competitions. Seto concluded the year's short course season at the 2012 world short course championships, where his hard work paid off in a big way.\n\nIn the competition, seto won his first international medals. He first secured a gold medal in the 400-metre individual medley by setting a new asian record with a time of 3:59.12, finishing more than a second and a half faster than the second-place swimmer, lászló cseh. Seto then went on to win a silver medal in the 200-metre individual medley, outpacing cseh again with a time of 1:52.80.\n\nThese achievements marked seto's transition from being a promising talent to becoming a top contender in global swimming competitions, paving the way for his impressive career ahead. \n\n<user> What are some of seto's most significant world records in swimming? \n\n<assistant> Daiya seto has set multiple world records throughout his illustrious career. Some of his most significant world records are:\n\n1. 200-metre butterfly (short course) - in 2018, seto achieved a world record in the 200-metre butterfly at the world short course championships held in hangzhou, china. He broke the record with an impressive time of 1:48.24.\n\n2. 400-metre individual medley (short course) - in 2019, seto set another world record during the international swimming league event in las vegas. He completed the 400-metre individual medley in a time of 3:54.81, breaking the previous record held by american swimmer ryan lochte.\n\nThese records showcase seto's exceptional talent and prowess in the sport, reflecting his dedication and skill in both butterfly and individual medley events.\n\nIn addition to these world records, seto has set numerous asian and national records, such as the long course 200-metre butterfly record (1:52.53) set at the 2020 fina champions swim series in beijing. This record placed him only behind the world record holder, kristóf milák of hungary, and the former world record holder, michael phelps of the united states, in terms of global rankings at that time.\n\nDaiya seto continues to be an influential figure in the swimming world and a source of inspiration for aspiring athletes globally.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you explain decision field theory in simple terms? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Decision field theory (dft) is a way to understand how people make decisions. It focuses on how our choices change over time until we make a final decision. Imagine you have to pick a dessert at a party. At first, you might like the cake, then you might think the ice cream looks better, and later you might decide the cookies are the best option. Dft uses math to explain how our thoughts about the choices change over time.\n\nThis theory helps predict what choices people make and how long it takes them to decide, even when they are unsure or in a hurry. It also helps explain why sometimes our decisions change depending on the situation or the available time. \n\n<user> What kind of puzzles in human choice behavior can dft account for? \n\n<assistant> Decision field theory has been successful in explaining many puzzling findings in human choice behavior. Some of these puzzles include:\n\n1. Violations of stochastic dominance: sometimes, people choose options that have a lower probability of a better outcome when there is a clearly better option available.\n\n2. Violations of strong stochastic transitivity: people may not always follow consistent choices when comparing multiple options.\n\n3. Violations of independence between alternatives: the presence of a new, irrelevant option can affect the choice between existing options.\n\n4. Serial-position effects on preference: the order in which options are presented might influence how people choose between them.\n\n5. Speed-accuracy tradeoff effects: the time people take to make decisions can affect the accuracy of their choices.\n\n6. Inverse relation between probability and decision time: the more uncertain people are about their options, the longer it might take them to decide.\n\n7. Changes in decisions under time pressure: when time is limited, different choices might be made compared to when there's ample time for reflection.\n\n8. Preference reversals between choices and prices: people might value options differently when asked to make a choice versus when asked to price them.\n\nDft helps provide insights and explanations for these behaviors, which are not always easy to understand using other decision-making theories. \n\n<user> Stopping rule and threshold in dft and how they affect decision-making? \n\n<assistant> In decision field theory, the stopping rule determines when a person makes their final choice. It is based on a threshold, which is a level of preference strength that an option must reach before it is chosen. When an option's preference strength crosses the threshold, the decision maker selects that option, and the process stops.\n\nThe threshold plays a crucial role in controlling speed-accuracy tradeoffs in decision-making. High thresholds require a stronger preference state, meaning more information about the options must be considered. This leads to a longer deliberation process and, usually, more accurate choices. Low thresholds need a weaker preference state, which means less information is required to make a decision. This results in quicker choices, but possibly less accuracy.\n\nFor example, under high time pressure, decision makers might have to lower their threshold and make quick, less accurate choices. Conversely, when there is less time pressure, they can afford to set a higher threshold and make more informed, accurate decisions by gathering more information. \n\n<user> How is decision field theory related to other theories in psychology, and does it have a connection with neuroscience? \n\n<assistant> Decision field theory is inspired by an earlier approach called the avoidance conflict model, which is a part of kurt lewin's field theory in psychology. Dft is also a member of sequential sampling models, a broader class of theories used in various fields of cognition to understand decision-making processes over time.\n\nDft also has a connection with neuroscience. Researchers have started to explore the link between the preference states and decision-making processes described by dft and the neural activities in the brain. This work helps scientists understand the neural basis of decision-making and how the brain processes information during choice deliberation.\n\nMoreover, the authors of decision field theory have recently been exploring a new theoretical direction called quantum cognition. This approach borrows concepts from quantum physics and applies them to cognitive processes such as decision making, reasoning, and memory, offering a fresh perspective on human cognition and potentially linking dft to even more scientific areas.

        "reference": "Decision field theory (DFT) is a dynamic-cognitive approach to human decision making. It is a cognitive model that describes how people actually make decisions rather than a rational or normative theory that prescribes what people should or ought to do. It is also a dynamic model of decision making rather than a static model, because it describes how a person's preferences evolve across time until a decision is reached rather than assuming a fixed state of preference. The preference evolution process is mathematically represented as a stochastic process called a diffusion process. It is used to predict how humans make decisions under uncertainty, how decisions change under time pressure, and how choice context changes preferences. This model can be used to predict not only the choices that are made but also decision or response times.\n\nThe paper \"Decision Field Theory\" was published by Jerome R. Busemeyer and James T. Townsend in 1993. The DFT has been shown to account for many puzzling findings regarding human choice behavior including violations of stochastic dominance, violations of strong stochastic transitivity, violations of independence between alternatives, serial-position effects on preference, speed accuracy tradeoff effects, inverse relation between probability and decision time, changes in decisions under time pressure, as well as preference reversals between choices and prices. The DFT also offers a bridge to neuroscience. Recently, the authors of decision field theory also have begun exploring a new theoretical direction called Quantum Cognition.\n\nIntroduction\nThe name decision field theory was chosen to reflect the fact that the inspiration for this theory comes from an earlier approach – avoidance conflict model contained in Kurt Lewin's general psychological theory, which he called field theory. DFT is a member of a general class of sequential sampling models that are commonly used in a variety of fields in cognition.\n\nThe basic ideas underlying the decision process for sequential sampling models is illustrated in Figure 1 below. Suppose the decision maker is initially presented with a choice between three risky prospects, A, B, C, at time t = 0. The horizontal axis on the figure represents deliberation time (in seconds), and the vertical axis represents preference strength. Each trajectory in the figure represents the preference state for one of the risky prospects at each moment in time.\n\nIntuitively, at each moment in time, the decision maker thinks about various payoffs of each prospect, which produces an affective reaction, or valence, to each prospect. These valences are integrated across time to produce the preference state at each moment. In this example, during the early stages of processing (between 200 and 300 ms), attention is focused on advantages favoring prospect C, but later (after 600 ms) attention is shifted toward advantages favoring prospect A. The stopping rule for this process is controlled by a threshold (which is set equal to 1.0 in this example): the first prospect to reach the top threshold is accepted, which in this case is prospect A after about two seconds. Choice probability is determined by the first option to win the race and cross the upper threshold, and decision time is equal to the deliberation time required by one of the prospects to reach this threshold.\n\nThe threshold is an important parameter for controlling speed–accuracy tradeoffs. If the threshold is set to a lower value (about .30) in Figure 1, then prospect C would be chosen instead of prospect A (and done so earlier). Thus decisions can reverse under time pressure. High thresholds require a strong preference state to be reached, which allows more information about the prospects to be sampled, prolonging the deliberation process, and increasing accuracy. Low thresholds allow a weak preference state to determine the decision, which cuts off sampling information about the prospects, shortening the deliberation process, and decreasing accuracy. Under high time pressure, decision makers must choose a low threshold; but under low time pressure, a higher threshold can be used to increase accuracy.",

Even though most of its territories eventually became prussian in 1815, many of the reforms introduced in westphalia remained in place. \n\n<user> It's interesting to see the progressive nature of this short-lived kingdom. how did the financial situation of the kingdom of westphalia become so bad? and what role did napoleon play in the kingdom's economy during its existence? lastly, how were these financial issues connected to the eventual downfall of the kingdom? \n\n<assistant> The kingdom of westphalia experienced financial difficulties largely due to heavy taxes and payments demanded by napoleon. The first french empire saw the kingdom as a source of revenue and conscripted soldiers to supplement its own armed forces. Many of these conscripts never returned from the campaigns, such as the invasion of russia in 1812.\n\nThe kingdom's economy was already relatively poor, and these financial obligations further strained its resources. By 1812, the kingdom of westphalia was essentially bankrupt. As napoleon's power waned and he retreated in the face of advancing allied forces in 1813, the ill-fated kingdom was overrun by the allies. In 1815, most of the kingdom's territories were absorbed by prussia. The financial collapse of the kingdom played a significant role alongside the weakening of napoleon's influence in the eventual downfall of the kingdom of westphalia. \n\n<user> Could you provide specific examples of how the modern reforms enacted by the kingdom of westphalia impacted other german states and influenced their development? \n\n<assistant> Certainly, the progressive reforms enacted by the kingdom of westphalia significantly influenced other german states in their development. One notable example is the shift toward granting equal rights to jews. The kingdom enacted germany's first laws granting jews equal rights in 1808, and this laid the groundwork for the expansion of similar rights and emancipation in other german states, such as prussia, bavaria, and baden.\n\nAnother key reform was the liberation of serfs and the introduction of equal rights for all citizens. This also resonated with other german states, leading to the abolition of serfdom and the establishment of the concept of citizenship. The move to grant everyone the right to a jury trial exemplifies the progress toward equal rights under the law in westphalia, which later spread to other states.\n\nThe enactment of the kingdom's modern-style constitution also impacted the political landscape. As the first monarchy in germany to introduce such a constitution, the kingdom of westphalia influenced other states to consider administrative and constitutional reforms. Although the kingdom itself did not survive, the ideas generated during its existence persisted and contributed to the subsequent evolution of governance and the growth of the german federation.\n\nThe kingdom of westphalia, as a napoleonic model state, showcased the potential for progressive legal and social change.

It included territory in Hesse and other parts of present-day Germany. While formally independent, it was a vassal state of the First French Empire and was ruled by Napoleon's brother Jérôme Bonaparte. It was named after Westphalia, but this was a misnomer since the kingdom had little territory in common with that area; rather the kingdom mostly covered territory formerly known as Eastphalia.\n\nNapoleon imposed the first written modern constitution in Germany, a French-style central administration, and agricultural reform. The Kingdom liberated the serfs and gave everyone equal rights and the right to a jury trial. In 1808 the Kingdom passed Germany's first laws granting Jews equal rights, thereby providing a model for reform in the other German states. Westphalia seemed to be progressive in immediately enacting and enforcing the new reforms.\n\nThe country was relatively poor but Napoleon demanded heavy taxes and payments and conscripted soldiers. Few of the men who marched into Russia with Napoleon in 1812 ever returned. The Kingdom was bankrupt by 1812. When Napoleon was retreating in the face of Allied advances in 1813, the Kingdom was overrun by the Allies and (in 1815) most of its territories became Prussian. Most of the reforms, however, remained in place.\n\nFormation\n\nThe Kingdom of Westphalia was created in 1807 by merging territories ceded by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Peace of Tilsit, among them the region of the Duchy of Magdeburg west of the Elbe River, the Brunswick-Lüneburg territories of Hanover and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and the Electorate of Hesse. Hesse's capital Cassel (modern spelling Kassel) then fulfilled the same function for Westphalia, and the king kept the court at the palace of Wilhelmshöhe, renamed Napoleonshöhe. The state was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine.\n\nSince it was intended as a Napoleonic \"model state\", a constitution was written and enacted by King Jérôme on 7 December 1807, the day after he had arrived in Cassel, making Westphalia the first monarchy in Germany with a modern-style constitution.",

John dewey believed that art and aesthetics were deeply connected to our everyday experiences. He thought that there's a continuity between enjoying artworks and everyday activities. Unlike kant and german idealists, who focused more on 'high art' or fine art, dewey emphasized that art's essence lies in the whole experience, not just the physical object. So, his theory gives importance to individual encounters and how art and society influence each other. \n\n<user> How does dewey's idea of the \"live creature\" fit into his aesthetic theory? \n\n<assistant> The \"live creature\" is a key concept in dewey's aesthetic theory. It refers to the person experiencing art or the environment around them. For dewey, the entire art process is about the development of an experience. The interaction between the individual, or the 'live creature,' and their environment forms the basis of his theory.\n\nDewey suggests that our senses receive data from the environment, and our perception of these stimuli is a summation. This biological sensory exchange between the 'live creature' and the environment is crucial to understanding his aesthetic theory, as it emphasizes the direct experience of individuals when encountering art.\n\nIn \"art as experience,\" dewey expands the boundaries of aesthetic philosophy by showing that art is connected to everyday experiences. By focusing on the 'live creature,' he underlines the importance of personal experience in understanding and appreciating art, rather than just concentrating on the artwork as an object. \n\n<user> How does dewey's theory of aesthetics apply to new media and various disciplines beyond art? \n\n<assistant> Dewey's theory of aesthetics, which emphasizes the role of experience in understanding and appreciating art, has been found useful in various disciplines and new media contexts. His idea of connecting art to everyday experiences can be applied to the way we interact with digital platforms, virtual reality, and interactive arts.\n\nFor example, when using social media or engaging with interactive installations, the user experience becomes as critical as the content being presented. In these contexts, dewey's focus on the process and the individual's encounter with the environment becomes highly relevant.\n\nMoreover, his emphasis on experience can also be applied to fields like education, where understanding different perspectives and providing engaging learning experiences is crucial. By considering the connections between art and everyday life, dewey's aesthetics theory encourages interdisciplinary thinking and opens up new ways to approach diverse fields, from technology to psychology. \n\n<user> I'm a bit confused about how dewey views the role of the individual art object within his aesthetic theory, considering that it is more focused on the process of the experience. can you elaborate on his thoughts regarding the individual art object and its significance within his theory? \n\n<assistant> Sure, let me explain it in simpler terms. While dewey's aesthetic theory focuses on the experience and the process as a whole, it doesn't mean that the individual art object loses its importance. In fact, it plays a significant role within the framework of his theory.\n\nFor dewey, the individual art object is the primary site where the experiences happen. It's like a gathering point where the artist and the observer, or the 'live creature,' can connect with each other, their personal thoughts and emotions, as well as the broader culture.\n\nThink of the art object as a meeting place. When people come together around a piece of art, they share their experiences with the artwork, the environment, and each other. In this sense, the individual art object serves as a unifying occasion that brings various experiences together.\n\nSo, rather than disregarding the importance of the art object, dewey's theory highlights the key role it plays in the formation of experiences. By focusing on the process and the experience, dewey's theory allows for a more profound appreciation of the individual art object, as it becomes the center stage where the connections between art, life, and society take place.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion you had about the role of the individual art object in dewey's aesthetic theory!

        "reference": "Art as Experience (1934) is  John Dewey's major writing on aesthetics, originally delivered as the first William James Lecture at Harvard (1932). Dewey's aesthetics have been found useful in a number of disciplines, including new media.\n\nDewey had previously written articles on aesthetics in the 1880s and had further addressed the matter in Democracy and Education (1915). In his major work, Experience and Nature (1925), he laid out the beginnings of a theory of aesthetic experience, and wrote two important essays for Philosophy and Civilization (1931).\n\nOverview \nDewey's theory is an attempt to shift the understandings of what is essential and characteristic about the art process from its physical manifestations in the ‘expressive object’ to the process in its entirety, a process whose fundamental element is no longer the material ‘work of art’ but rather the development of an ‘experience’. Experience is something that personally affects one's life. That is why these theories are so crucial to people's social and educational life.\n\nSuch a change in emphasis does not imply, though, that the individual art object has lost significance; far from it, its primacy is clarified: one recognizes an object as the primary site for the dialectical processes of experience, as the unifying occasion for these experiences. Through the expressive object, the artist and the active observer encounter each other, their material and mental environments, and their culture at large.\n\nThe description of the actual act of experiencing is drawn heavily from the biological/psychological theories Dewey expounded in his development of functional psychology. In Dewey's article on reflex arc psychology, he writes that sensory data and worldly stimulus enter into the individual via the channels of afferent sense organs and that the perception of these stimuli is a 'summation' (quote marks not needed. it was and is a valid conception of a well-researched phenomenon. it was treated generally by James in Principles of Psychology (1890) and specifically there in Chapter 3, under Summation of Stimuli: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/57628/57628-h/57628-h.htm): \n\nThe biological sensory exchange between man, whom Dewey calls 'the Live Creature' in Art as Experience, and the environment, is the basis of his aesthetic theory:\n\n  \nThis quotation is a dramatic expansion of the bounds of aesthetic philosophy, for it demonstrates the connections of art with everyday experience and in doing so reminds people of the highest responsibilities that art and society and the individual have always owed to each other:\n\nTo emphasize what is aesthetic about an experience is not to highlight what is apolitical or impractical or otherwise marginal about that experience; instead, it is to emphasize in what ways that experience, as aesthetic, is a 'manifestation, a record, and celebration of the life of a civilization, a means for promoting its development' and, insofar as that aesthetic experience relates to the kinds of experiences had in general, it is also the 'ultimate judgment upon the quality of a civilization.'\n\nSee his Experience and Nature for an extended discussion of 'Experience' in Dewey's philosophy.\n\nChapters\n\nThe Live Creature\nJohn Dewey offers a new theory of art and the aesthetic experience. Dewey proposes that there is a continuity between the refined experience of works of art and everyday activities and events, and in order to understand the aesthetic one must begin with the events and scenes of daily life. This idea stands in opposition to the aesthetic theories presented by Immanuel Kant and also the proponents of German Idealism, which have historically been shown to favor certain heavily classicized forms of art, known commonly as 'High Art' or Fine Art.",

Barlaam, trained in western scholastic theology, believed in a more intellectual and propositional approach, whereas gregory palamas defended the hesychast tradition.\n\nThe primary points of disagreement are:\n\n1. The nature of the light on mount tabor: barlaam argued that the light experienced during the transfiguration was created, whereas palamas claimed it was uncreated and divine, representing the uncreated energies of god accessible to humans through hesychastic practice.\n\n2. The jesus prayer: barlaam accused the hesychasts of being similar to the bogomils and criticized the practice of the jesus prayer for not proclaiming christ as god. Palamas, however, defended the prayer's role in hesychasm and viewed it as a connection to god.\n\n3. The experience of god: barlaam viewed any claim of a real and conscious experience of god as messalianism, while palamas believed one could attain such experience through hesychastic practice.\n\n4. The role of worldly wisdom: barlaam emphasized the importance of worldly wisdom for the perfection of monks, while palamas focused on the transformative power of the holy spirit working through hesychasm.\n\nIn response to barlaam's attacks, palamas wrote the triads to defend hesychasm and those who practiced it. Their disagreements would eventually lead to several synods in constantinople, culminating in palamas' triumph over his critics in 1351. \n\n<user> As an expert, i'm more interested in understanding the structure, purpose, and development of the triads of gregory palamas. how were they written to address the controversies surrounding hesychasm? \n\n<assistant> The triads of gregory palamas were written as a defense of hesychasm and those who practiced it. Composed of nine treatises, the triads are organized into three sets of three treatises, hence the name. They were written in three stages:\n\n1. First triad: written in the second half of the 1330s, this triad was based on personal discussions between palamas and barlaam. However, barlaam is not mentioned by name in these texts. This stage marks the beginning of palamas' defense against barlaam's critiques.\n\n2. Hagioritic tome: drafted in early 1341 with the support of the monastic communities of mount athos, this document focuses on defending hesychastic practices and beliefs. Although barlaam is not mentioned by name, the work clearly targets his views on hesychasm.\n\n3. Triads in response to \"against the messalians\": barlaam's treatise, \"against the messalians,\" attacked gregory by name for the first time. In response, palamas composed additional treatises to reinforce and clarify his defense of hesychasm.\n\nThe purpose of the triads was to systematically address and refute barlaam's criticisms surrounding hesychasm. Palamas engaged with barlaam's arguments and provided theological and philosophical support for hesychast practices, such as the experience of the uncreated light, the role of the jesus prayer, and the importance of the holy spirit in transforming practitioners. By writing the triads, palamas aimed to solidify the legitimacy of hesychasm as a valid path to experiencing god within eastern orthodoxy. \n\n<user> As a regular person trying to learn from this historical debate, what can i take away from the differences between barlaam and palamas' teachings and their impact on eastern orthodoxy? \n\n<assistant> The debate between barlaam and gregory palamas highlights the importance of understanding and engaging with diverse perspectives within a religious tradition. From this historical debate, you can take away the following lessons:\n\n1. Different approaches to spirituality: the exchange between barlaam and palamas showcases two different approaches to spirituality within eastern orthodoxy – an intellectual and propositional approach represented by barlaam, and the mystical, experiential focus of hesychasm defended by palamas.\n\n2. The value of persistence in defending one's beliefs: palamas' determination in defending hesychasm through his writings ultimately led to the recognition of his teachings, culminating in his triumph at the synod of 1351. His persistence demonstrates the importance of standing up for one's beliefs, especially when facing challenges.\n\n3. The significance of dialogue and debate: the exchange between barlaam and palamas contributed to the intellectual and theological development of eastern orthodoxy. It demonstrates that engaging in dialogue and debate can lead to a better understanding of one's own beliefs as well as the opposing views.\n\n4. The transformative power of spiritual practice: the teachings of gregory palamas, particularly the emphasis on the holy spirit's role in transforming hesychasts, underscore the importance of spiritual practice in one's personal growth and connection with the divine.\n\nIn conclusion, the differences between barlaam and palamas' teachings offer valuable insights into the complexities of religious practices and beliefs. It is crucial to engage with these differing perspectives to enrich our understanding of spirituality and the variety of paths that people can take to seek connection with the divine. ",

The treatises are called \"Triads\" because they were organized as three sets of three treatises.\n\nBackground\n\nHesychasm attracted the attention of Barlaam a convert to Eastern Orthodoxy<ref>9. The Ninth Ecumenical Council of 1341 condemned the Platonic mysticism of Barlaam the Calabrian who had come from the West as a convert to Orthodoxy. Of course the rejection of Platonic type of mysticism was traditional practice for the Fathers. But what the Fathers of this Council were completely shocked at was Barlaam’s claim that God reveals His will by bringing into existence creatures to be seen and heard and which He passes back into non existence after His revelation has been received. One of these supposed creatures was the Angel of The Lord Himself Who appeared to Moses in the burning bush. For the Fathers of the Ecumenical Councils this Angel is the uncreated Logos Himself. 'This unbelievable nonsense of Barlaam turned out to be that of Augustine himself. (see e.g. his De Trinitate, Books A and B) and of the whole Franco-Latin tradition till today\" (John S. Romanides, Underlying Positions of This Website).</ref> who encountered Hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices during a visit to Mount Athos; he had also read the writings of Palamas, himself an Athonite monk. Trained in Western Scholastic theology, Barlaam was scandalized by hesychasm and began to combat it both orally and in his writings. As a private teacher of theology in the Western Scholastic mode, Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the Hesychasts taught.\n\nOn the Hesychast side, the controversy was taken up by Palamas who was asked by his fellow monks on Mt Athos to defend hesychasm from the attacks of Barlaam. Palamas was well-educated in Greek philosophy. Gregory wrote a number of works in its defense and defended hesychasm at six different synods in Constantinople ultimately triumphing over its attackers in the synod of 1351.\n\nIn early 1341 Gregory drafted the Hagioritic Tome with the support of the monastic communities of Mount Athos.  Although Palamas does not mention Barlaam by name, the work clearly takes aim at Barlaam's views.  In response, Barlaam drafted \"Against the Messalians\", which attacked Gregory by name for the first time.\nBarlaam derisively called the Hesychasts omphalopsychoi (men with their souls in their navels) and accused them of the heresy of Messalianism, also known as Bogomilism in the East.1. His teaching about the light on Mt. Tabor, which he claimed was created.\n\n2. His criticisms of the Jesus Prayer, which he accused of being a practise of the Bogomils; also charged it with not proclaiming Christ as God.\nGregory Palamas: Historical Timeline\nAppendix I:Timeline: Barlaam and the Councils of 1341 from Baron Meyendorff  According to Meyendorff, Barlaam viewed \"any claim of real and conscious experience of God as Messalianism\".\"accusing Gregory Palamas of Messalianism\" ( Antonio Carile, Η Θεσσαλονίκη ως κέντρο Ορθοδόξου θεολογίας -προοπτικές στη σημερινή Ευρώπη (Thessaloniki 2000, pp. 131–140), English translation provided by the Apostoliki Diakonia of the Church of Greece).\n\nBarlaam also took exception to the doctrine held by the Hesychasts as to the uncreated nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of Hesychast practice, regarding it as heretical and blasphemous. It was maintained by the Hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to the light which had been manifested to Jesus' disciples on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration.  Barlaam viewed this doctrine of \"uncreated light\" to be polytheistic because as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God. Barlaam accuses the use of the Jesus Prayer as being a practice of Bogomilism.\n\nIn contrast to Palamas' teaching that the \"glory of God\" revealed in various episodes of Jewish and Christian Scripture (e.g., the burning bush seen by Moses, the Light on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration) was in fact the uncreated Energies of God (i.e., the grace of God), Barlaam held that they were created effects, because no part of God whatsoever could be directly perceived by humans. The Orthodox interpreted his position as denying the renewing power of the Holy Spirit, which, in the words of various Eastern Orthodox hymns, \"made apostles out of fishermen\" (i.e., makes saints even out of uneducated people). In his anti-hesychastic works Barlaam held that knowledge of worldly wisdom was necessary for the perfection of the monks and denied the possibility of the vision of the divine life.\n\nThe Triads\n\nIn response to Barlaam's attacks, Palamas wrote nine treatises entitled \"Triads For The Defense of Those Who Practice Sacred Quietude\".  The treatises are called \"Triads\" because they were organized as three sets of three treatises.\n\nThe Triads were written in three stages.

The incident was hugely controversial, but it directly led to a multiple-fold increase of traffic going into the website.\n\nSince then, however, readership has been on a decline, in the wake of emergence of alternative automotive websites coupled with the fact that the website is left to auto-pilot, surviving mainly on user generated contents since 2004 (after half the team was slashed to keep cost low) while the Hong Leong management go on an active lookout for a buyer.\n\nIn 2008, Hong Leong finally offloaded AW to Jobstreet.com’s wholly owned subsidiary, Autoworld.com.my Sdn. Bhd., who assumed complete ownership of the website.\n\nEditorial \n\nMalaysian auto journalist Chips Yap was hired as Autoworld.com.my’s editor in year 2000. He remained as editor until 2004, when he left to help start rival website Motor Trader, and was replaced by the aforementioned YS Khong, who still remains as the website’s editor today.\n \nOne such member, simply known as TheGunner, joined the writing team in late 2008, and has been actively contributing content since then. Other content contributors include Chan Eu Jin, drexchan, tedtarg, jimijamison and jaime. Chan Eu Jin is said to be the former president and founder of V-Sixers Club – a reputable owners’ club for the Proton Perdana V6 formed in 2001, while drexchan is co-owner of a business specializing in performance parts and accessories.\n\nControversy \n\nShortly prior to its launch in 2004, pictures of the Proton Gen.2, then known as the Wira Replacement Model (WRM) was leaked into the internet, first appearing in Autoworld.com.my’s photo section, uploaded by a registered user. The incident saw Proton lodge a police report to investigate the leak, resulting in then-editor Chips Yap and some Autoworld staff being summoned to record statements in the Ibu Pejabat Polis Kontinjen Kuala Lumpur .",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> What is a coblation tonsillectomy and how does it work? \n\n<assistant> A coblation tonsillectomy is a type of surgical procedure where a patient's tonsils are removed by destroying the surrounding tissues that attach them to the pharynx. This method uses low-temperature radio frequency energy during the surgery, causing less pain and faster healing than traditional heat-based methods.\n\nThe equipment for coblation tonsillectomy includes an rf generator, foot pedal control, irrigation system, and a special wand called the tonsil wand. The generator provides radio frequency energy, which travels through saline solution between the wand's active and base electrodes, forming charged ions. This creates a plasma field around the electrodes that is responsible for breaking down the tissue in a controlled way.\n\nThe plasma field has a small radius and is stable thanks to the continuous flow of saline solution. It is carefully controlled to prevent damage to healthy tissue around the tonsils. With no thermal effect on tissue, the temperature during coblation tonsillectomy is significantly lower than other methods, like electrosurgery, and helps minimize harm to the surrounding tissues.\n\nThere are several reasons for surgically removing tonsils using coblation tonsillectomy, including frequent tonsillitis, swollen or inflamed tonsils causing breathing problems, bleeding from the tonsils, and rare diseases or viruses affecting them. Like any medical surgery, risks associated with this procedure can include reactions to general anesthesia, swelling, and rare cases of bleeding. \n\n<user> Thank you for the explanation. differences between coblation tonsillectomy and traditional tonsillectomy methods, and why is coblation considered a better option? \n\n<assistant> Of course! The main difference between coblation tonsillectomy and traditional methods, such as electrocautery tonsillectomy, lies in the technology utilized and the level of pain and healing time for the patient. \n\nCoblation tonsillectomy uses low-temperature radio frequency energy to break down the molecular bonds in the targeted tissue, which creates a plasma field for removing soft tissues. This process generates temperatures of around 60°C to 70°C during the procedure, substantially lower than those produced in electrocautery tonsillectomy, which can reach 400°C to 600°C.\n\nDue to these lower temperatures, coblation tonsillectomy causes minimal thermal damage to tissues surrounding the targeted area, which results in less pain and a faster healing process for the patient. Electrocautery tonsillectomy, on the other hand, relies on heat generation and may cause more discomfort and longer healing times.\n\nSince its introduction in 2001, coblation tonsillectomy has been used in over 10 million operations, and research is still ongoing to determine its long-term effects. However, the benefits of reduced pain and faster healing make coblation tonsillectomy an attractive option compared to traditional heat-based methods. \n\n<user> Thanks for the clarification! i'm curious about tonsils' importance in our immune system, and how our bodies get by when they're removed after tonsillectomy? \n\n<assistant> Tonsils play a role in the body's immune system, particularly in children, as they create white blood cells to help fight diseases, bacteria, and viruses that enter through the mouth. They serve as a first line of defense against these invaders. However, their importance decreases as individuals grow older and are exposed to more bacteria and viruses, developing immunity to them.\n\nBy adulthood, the immune system function provided by tonsils becomes less critical, as the immune system has developed other ways of defending against infections. The body can still function effectively without tonsils, but their removal is not recommended unless medically warranted.\n\nTonsillectomies are often performed due to recurrent tonsillitis, enlarged tonsils causing breathing problems, or other medical conditions that negatively affect a patient's health. When tonsils are removed, the remaining parts of the immune system typically compensate for the absence of tonsils, and most people see little to no change in their overall immune response after the procedure.\n\nIt is important to note that tonsillectomy should only be performed for valid medical reasons to ensure the individual's health benefits from the surgery without the unnecessary exposure to the associated risks. \n\n<user> Are there any specific aftercare instructions for patients recovering from a coblation tonsillectomy? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are aftercare instructions to help ensure a smooth recovery after a coblation tonsillectomy. Some of these guidelines include:\n\n1. Pain management: patients may experience some pain and discomfort after the surgery. Doctors typically prescribe pain relief medication to help manage any discomfort during the healing process.\n\n2. Hydration: staying hydrated is crucial after the procedure, as it helps in healing and prevents dehydration. Patients should drink plenty of water and avoid drinks that might irritate the throat, such as acidic or carbonated beverages.\n\n3. Diet: initially, consuming soft, cold, or lukewarm foods can help ease any pain or discomfort during the recovery period. Examples include ice cream, gelatin, mashed potatoes, and applesauce. Gradually transitioning to solid foods is recommended as the patient’s comfort allows.\n\n4. Rest: adequate rest is essential to a speedy recovery. It is advised to avoid strenuous physical activities, such as sports or heavy lifting, for a couple of weeks after the surgery.\n\n5. Oral hygiene: maintaining good oral hygiene is important but should be done gently. Patients should avoid vigorous gargling or mouthwashing and instead try gentle rinsing with warm saltwater.\n\n6. Follow-up appointments: attending all follow-up appointments with your doctor is crucial to ensure proper healing and address any potential complications.\n\nIt is vital to follow the specific advice and instructions provided by the patient's healthcare team, as individual recommendations may vary depending on their circumstances and the surgical approach used. If any complications or concerns arise during the recovery process, patients should consult their healthcare provider immediately. ",

        "reference": "Coblation tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure in which the patient's tonsils are removed by destroying the surrounding tissues that attach them to the pharynx. It was first implemented in 2001. The word coblation is short for ‘controlled ablation’, which means a controlled procedure used to destroy soft tissue.\n\nThis procedure uses low temperature radio frequency during the operation, which was found to cause less pain for the patient than previous technologies used for tonsillectomy. Data collected from coblation tonsillectomy operations showed that the healing of the tonsillar fossa is much faster when this low temperature technology is used instead of a heat based technology, such as electrocautery tonsillectomy.\n\nSince coblation has been introduced to the medical field, more than 10 million surgical operations have been performed, but as of 2019, research is still ongoing to determine the positive and negative effects of this procedure.\n\nTechnology\n\nComponents \nThe equipment used for coblation tonsillectomy consists of a radio frequency (RF) generator, foot pedal control, irrigation system, and a tonsil wand. The generator provides radio frequency, which is essential for the procedure, and connects the foot pedal system to the tonsil wand. The foot pedals are colour coded to prevent confusion: one is yellow and is used for controlling the coblation, while the other is blue and used for controlling the radio frequency cautery. The wand is connected to the RF generator so it can be controlled with the pedals. The wand consists of a base electrode and an active electrode, which have ceramic and flowing saline between them. The radio frequency current that is produced by the generator travels through the saline, breaking the molecular bonds and forming ions. This creates a plasma field around the electrodes, which is used for removing soft tissue. There should not be any smoke produced while the coblation wand is being used during the operation; if this occurs, it is a sign that ablated tissue has entered the coblation wand's electrode area. This means that the current is not able to break down the saline into ions properly, so smoke is produced. When this happens, the coblation wand needs to be cleaned out before using it again.\n\nPlasma field \nThe plasma field has a radius of about 100μm-200μm around the electrodes and is kept stable within the head of the coblation wand by the continuous supply of saline. Furthermore, the plasma field is controlled by the bipolar energy between the negative and positive ions that are produced by the plasma in order to use a precise amount of plasma to prevent damaging healthy tissues around the tonsils.\n\nPlasma does not have a thermal effect on tissue: it only affects it on a chemical level. The plasma field produces positively charged hydrogen ions (H+) and negatively charged hydroxide ions (OH-), which enable plasma to destroy tissue. There is no or only minor damage done to nearby tissues during the coblation procedure because charged particles move between the generated plasma field and the ablated tissue, hence the molecules breakdown without the temperatures rising high.\n\nThe temperature for coblation tonsillectomy ranged from 60 °C to 70 °C, while other tonsillectomy operation procedures, such as electrosurgery require temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 600 °C, which is much higher. Thus, coblation is considered to be a non-heat focused medical procedure that is much better at causing minimal thermal damage to untargeted tissues near the targeted area.\n\nReasons for surgery \nThe need for removing tonsils of an individual using the coblation tonsillectomy surgical process can occur for four reasons. Firstly, the patient may have frequent long lasting tonsillitis. Secondly, tonsils can become swollen and inflamed which may cause breathing problems. Thirdly, blood loss can occur through the tonsils, which is a sign that they need to be removed. Lastly, in some cases tonsils get affected by rare diseases and viruses, which can only be treated by removing the tonsils.\n\nTonsillitis \nTonsils are part of the first line of defense in the mouth as they create white blood cells in order to fight diseases, bacteria and viruses that enter through the mouth. Owing to being exposed to amounts of material that enter the mouth, tonsils can become infected, which is called tonsillitis. This occurs mainly in children as in this age group is when the tonsils are the key providers of immune system functions. By the time individuals reach adulthood, they have been exposed to many diseases, bacteria and viruses, so they have developed immunity against these infection causing micro-organisms. Thus, adults normally do not need the help of tonsils anymore.\n\nWhen tonsillitis occurs regularly, meaning about seven times a year then the removal of tonsils is needed, otherwise it can have detrimental effects on the individual's health. Furthermore, tonsil surgery may be required when antibiotic treatment does not help in getting rid of the bacteria, which causes tonsillitis.\n\nSwollen tonsils \nAfter being exposed to several tonsil infections, tonsils have the tendency to become swollen and inflamed, but other factors may make them enlarged as well, such as genetics. Some of the significant problems that can arise due to having enlarged tonsils are breathing difficulties and the ability to swallow, thus the removal of tonsils is required.\n\nOther conditions \nAfter having frequent tonsil infections or severe diseases, bleeding from the tonsils tissues can occur. Furthermore, cancer cells can develop in the tonsil tissues. These are mostly uncommon but can still occur and can only be treated by surgically removing the tonsils from the both sides of the back of the throat.\n\nRisks of the surgery \nSimilarly to any other medical surgery, coblation tonsillectomy has health risk factors as well, which can but will not necessarily occur from the surgery. Firstly, reactions to the general anesthetic drug, which is used to make the patients sleep while they are under surgery, can cause both short-term and long-term health problems, for example minor health problems like vomiting, nausea, muscle soreness, headache, and major health problems can include death. Another risk factor is that swelling can occur throughout the whole mouth during the beginning section of the surgery, but swelling is most likely to occur on the tongue and in the tissues surrounding the tonsils at the back of the throat. Furthermore, rarely bleeding may be present in the tonsil area of the mouth throughout the surgical procedure, which would need extra treatment on top of the coblation tonsillectomy surgery. This would require the patient to remain in the hospital for a longer period of time in order to fully recover.",

He has an older brother named adam. Growing up, mamadou played soccer and did not take up basketball seriously at a young age.\n\nIn 2010, everything changed when amadou koundoul, who was then the assistant coach for the uc irvine anteaters men's basketball team, noticed n'diaye playing in a pick-up game in a gymnasium in dakar. Koundoul saw potential in n'diaye and invited him to travel to the united states to play basketball. N'diaye accepted the offer, even though he didn't speak english at the time.\n\nUpon arriving in the u.s., n'diaye struggled with the english language and often needed translations to french. He initially attended stoneridge prep in simi valley, california, which had a history of helping top international basketball players such as enes kanter and nikola vučević. However, due to california interscholastic federation rules, n'diaye was unable to participate in the sport during his first year at the high school. \n\nAs a sophomore, he transferred to brethren christian school in huntington beach, california, where he played under coach jon bahnsen. At the time, mamadou was 7 ft 5 in tall and considered one of the tallest high school basketball players in the u.s. Due to his height, guinness world records even approached the school to confirm if he was indeed the world's tallest high school player.\n\nN'diaye's life took an unexpected turn after experiencing headaches shortly after arriving in america. A doctor diagnosed him with a golf ball-sized tumor in his pituitary gland that was causing his excessive growth and threatening his vision. With the help of charitable donations from the local community and a married couple from huntington beach, california, who became his guardians, n'diaye underwent medical treatment at the hoag memorial hospital.\n\nDespite the challenges, n'diaye's perseverance and talent led him to extraordinary success in high school basketball, eventually earning him the opportunity to play for the uc irvine anteaters men's basketball team. \n\n<user> How did mamadou n'diaye perform in his college basketball career? \n\n<assistant> Mamadou n'diaye showed great promise during his time at the university of california, irvine, playing for the uc irvine anteaters men's basketball team. Standing at an impressive 7 ft 6 in, n'diaye was one of the tallest basketball players within the ncaa division i.\n\nAs a center, he was named the big west conference defensive player of the year after the 2013-14 ncaa division i men's basketball season and earned all-conference honorable mention accolades. N'diaye completed his sophomore year at the university of california, irvine, and his second season with the anteaters in 2014-15.\n\nOne of his main strengths was his ability to block shots effectively. He accumulated an astonishing 131 blocks in his first 49 collegiate games, asserting himself as a dominant defensive presence on the court. Despite his successful college career, n'diaye decided to enter the nba draft following his junior season, ending his college eligibility.\n\nN'diaye's college performance garnered significant attention and eventually led to his opportunity to play for the golden state warriors development league team, furthering his professional basketball career.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> What exactly is a variable gauge system and how it works? how do trains with different track gauges manage to travel across breaks in gauges without stopping? \n\n<assistant> A variable gauge system enables railway vehicles in a train to travel across a break of gauge caused by two railway networks with differing track gauges. It eliminates the need for dual gauge tracks or transshipment, providing a smoother and faster transition between networks.\n\nFor a train to operate through different gauges, it must be equipped with special bogies holding variable gauge wheelsets. These wheelsets contain a variable gauge axle (vga). As the train passes through a gauge changer or gauge changing facility, the track widens or narrows to adjust the train's gauge. The wheels are unlocked, moved closer together or further apart, and then re-locked to match the next track's gauge.\n\nSeveral variable gauge axle systems are in use around the world, like talgo-rd, caf-brava, db cargo–knorr-bremse, dbag–rafil type v, japan railways rtri, and pkp suw 2000. However, not every system is compatible with each other.\n\nA gauge changer is the device that enables gauge adjustment in the wheels. It features a pair of running rails that gradually vary in width between the two gauges, in addition to other rails and levers to unlock, move, and re-lock the adjustable axles. \n\nThe variable gauge system is particularly important in international railway traffic because gauge changes tend to happen more frequently at international borders. This technology has been implemented on several international links such as spain/france, sweden/finland, poland/lithuania, and poland/ukraine.\n\nThough some limitations exist, such as those regarding suitability for motive power or requiring unloading before gauge changing, variable gauge systems overall offer a fast, efficient solution to the challenge of different track gauges. \n\n<user> Can you describe the compatibility and interoperability between these different variable gauge axle systems? also, i read about a unichanger in development that can handle multiple vga systems. how does that work, and what is its progress? \n\n<assistant> The compatibility and interoperability between different variable gauge axle systems vary. For instance, only the suw 2000 and rafil type v systems are interoperable, while the talgo-rd and caf-brava systems are also compatible with each other. Different systems may not work together seamlessly, which can pose challenges in international railway traffic.\n\nIn 2009, a unichanger was under development near tarragona, in roda de barà. This unique gauge changer is designed to handle four different vga systems simultaneously, providing increased flexibility and compatibility across various networks. By catering to multiple vga systems, the unichanger can significantly enhance international rail traffic by simplifying the gauge-changing process for trains.\n\nHowever, the current development status or progress of the unichanger is not mentioned in the provided information. \n\n<user> You mentioned some variable gauge systems have limitations, such as being unsuitable for motive power, requiring unloading before gauge changing, or applicable only to certain types of rolling stock. could you explain these limitations in more detail and provide examples of specific systems where these limitations apply? \n\n<assistant> Certainly. Different variable gauge systems come with their own limitations, which affect their usability and application for certain types of railway vehicles or conditions.\n\n1. Unsuitable for motive power: some systems might not be well-suited for locomotives or other types of motive power, especially ones designed for passenger traffic. An example of this limitation is the variable gauge used in spain, where trains primarily run on a mix of dedicated high-speed lines and older iberian gauge lines.\n\n2. Unloading requirement: certain systems might need rolling stock (like freight or passenger cars) to be unloaded prior to undergoing the gauge-changing process. This limitation can affect cargo transportation when using variable gauge systems; however, the provided information does not specify any particular vga system.\n\n3. Rolling stock limitations: some variable gauge axles might be designed only for carriages and wagons, and thus wouldn’t be applicable to locomotives or other rolling stock types. One such example is the db cargo–knorr-bremse system. \n\n<user> What countries currently use variable gauge systems for their train network? \n\n<assistant> Several countries have implemented variable gauge systems to facilitate train operations across different track gauges. Here is a list of some countries using variable gauge systems and the associated international links:\n\n1. Spain: variable gauge systems are prevalent in spain, especially for passenger traffic. Trains using this technology operate on a mix of high-speed lines (using standard gauge) and older lines (using iberian gauge). Spain has also implemented this system on the international link between spain and france.\n\n2. France: as mentioned, the country has cooperated with spain to establish a variable gauge system on their international link, allowing for better connectivity between the two railway networks.\n\n3. Sweden: variable gauge systems are used on the international link between sweden and finland with swedish trains, simplifying cross-border train operations.\n\n4. Finland: the international link between sweden and finland also utilizes variable gauge systems enabling finnish trains to travel across the border seamlessly.\n\n5. Poland: poland uses variable gauge systems on its international links with lithuania and ukraine, allowing polish trains to travel across different track gauges without disruptions.\n\n6. Lithuania: the international link between poland and lithuania facilitates lithuanian trains to seamlessly pass through different track gauges, thanks to the variable gauge systems.\n\n7. Ukraine: similar to lithuania, the poland-ukraine international link also deploys variable gauge systems for the trains' smooth operation across the differing gauges.\n\nWhile this list provides an overview of some countries using variable gauge systems, others may also have adopted the technology for their railway networks. As seamless transitions between different gauges become increasingly important in international railway traffic, more nations are likely to invest in variable gauge systems for better connectivity and efficiency.

In effect, the track widens or narrows.\n\nAs the train passes through the gauge changer, the wheels are unlocked, moved closer together, or further apart, and are then re-locked. Installed variable gauge systems exist within the internal network of Spain, and are installed on international links between Spain/France (Spanish train), Sweden/Finland (Swedish train), Poland/Lithuania (Polish train) and Poland/Ukraine (Polish train).\n\nA system for changing gauge, without need for stopping is widespread for passenger traffic in Spain, used in services run on a mix of dedicated high-speed lines (using Standard gauge) and older lines (using Iberian gauge). Similar systems for freight traffic are still rather incipient, as the higher axle weight increases the technological challenge. Although several alternatives exist, including transferring freight, replacing individual wheels and axles, truck exchange, transporter flatcars or the simple transshipment of freight or passengers, they are impractical, thus a cheap and fast system for changing gauge would be beneficial for cross-border freight traffic.\n\nAlternative names include Gauge Adjustable Wheelsets (GAW), Automatic Track Gauge Changeover System (ATGCS/TGCS), Rolling Stock Re-Gauging System (RSRS), Rail Gauge Adjustment System (RGAS), Shifting wheelset, Variable Gauge Rolling Truck, track gauge change and track change wheelset.\n\nOverview \nVariable gauge axles help solve the problem of a break-of-gauge without having to resort to dual gauge tracks or transshipment. Systems allow the adjustment between two gauges. No gauge changer designs supporting more than two gauges are used.\n\nSystems \n\nThere are several variable gauge axle systems:\n Talgo-RD (from Talgo).\n The Talgo system has been in revenue service in Portbou and Irun, on the Spanish-French border, since 1969\n It is used on the Strizh train between Moscow and Berlin.\n CAF-BRAVA (from Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles)\n The BRAVA system was originally designed in 1968 by the Vevey Company (since absorbed by Bombardier Transportation), a company located in the city of Vevey on Lake Geneva, in Switzerland.  The system was originally called the \"Vevey axle\".<ref>{{cite web|work=La Vie du Rail, No. 1415, 4 November 1973|title= ÉCARTEMENTS VARIABLES: L' \"ESSIEU MIRACLE\" EST-IL NÉ DANS LE CANTON DE VAUD?|url=http://www.laviedurail.com|language=fr}}</ref> The design was subsequently obtained and improved by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF).\n DB Cargo–Knorr-Bremse. being developed in 2002 for use between Europe and Russia.\n DBAG–Rafil Type V for freight (from  for Deutsche Bahn).\n Japan Railways RTRI (from the Japan Railway Technical Research Institute) to be used on motorised axles.\n PKP SUW 2000 system produced by ZNTK Poznań for Polish State Railways.\n\n The Montreux-Oberland Bernois (MOB) railway, Switzerland in preparation by Prose of Winterthur /.\n\n Compatibility \nThe variable gauge systems are not themselves all compatible. Only the SUW 2000 and Rafil Type V systems are interoperable, as are TALGO-RD and CAF-BRAVA.\n\nIn 2009, at Roda de Barà near Tarragona, a Unichanger capable of handling four different VGA systems was under development.\n\n International traffic \nVGA is particularly important with international railway traffic because gauge changes tend to occur more often at international borders.\n\nFeatures\nDifferent systems have different limitations, for example, some can be used on carriages and wagons only and are unsuitable for motive power, while others require that rolling stock is unloaded before going through the gauge changer.\n\n Speed \nThe maximum speed of the trains equipped with the different technologies varies. Only CAF and Talgo produce high-speed VGA, allowing speeds up to 250 km/h.\n\n Gauge changer \n\nA gauge changer is a device which forces the gauge adjustment in the wheels. Designs consist of a pair of running rails that gradually vary in width between the two gauges, combined with other rails and levers to unlock, move, support and re-lock the adjustable axles.\n\nIn the Spanish Talgo-RD system, a constant spray of water is used to lubricate the metal surfaces, to reduce heat and wear. A Talgo-RD gauge changer is 20 metres long and 6 metres wide.\n\n Operation \nVariable gauge multiple units, or a train including a variable gauge locomotive (e.g. Talgo 250) and rolling stock, may drive straight across a gauge changer.  Normally the locomotive will not be able to change gauge, meaning that it must move out of the way whilst the remainder of the train itself passes through. On the opposite side, a new locomotive of the other gauge will couple to the train.\n\nA train (or an individual car) can be pushed halfway across the gauge-changer, uncoupled, and then (once far enough across) coupled to the new locomotive and pulled the rest of the way.",

The existing area code, 215, could no longer accommodate the increasing number of telephone users. Later, area code 484 was added as an overlay because the region experienced more growth, and there was a significant increase in cell phone and pager usage, which caused a higher demand for phone numbers. \n\n<user> I've understood the historical aspect, but are there any significant differences for the residents when it comes to using these area codes in their day-to-day life? how does the introduction of a new area code impact them? \n\n<assistant> When a new area code is introduced, such as the 484 overlay for the 610 region, residents need to adapt to mandatory ten-digit dialing. This means they have to dial both the area code and the local number, even for local calls. Adjusting to this change might take some time, but it ensures a more systematic way of assigning numbers and helps accommodate the increasing demand for phone numbers in the region without major disruptions to the existing users.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> International mathematical olympiad? \n\n<assistant> Of course! The international mathematical olympiad (imo) is an annual competition for pre-college students, featuring six highly challenging mathematical problems. Established in 1959, it is the oldest among the international science olympiads. About 100 countries participate in this event, sending teams of up to six students, one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.\n\nThe problems at the imo cover a wide range of mathematical topics, including complex algebra, pre-calculus, projective and complex geometry, functional equations, and number theory. Although calculus is allowed in the solutions, it is not required as the problems are designed to be understood by anyone with a basic grasp of mathematics, but their solutions demand more advanced knowledge and ingenuity.\n\nThe selection process for the imo varies by country, usually involving a series of tests with gradually increasing difficulty. Students must be under 20 years old and cannot be registered at a tertiary institution. They can participate in the imo multiple times, subject to these conditions. Awards are given to a percentage of the individual contestants, while team scores are unofficially compared, putting more emphasis on individual achievements rather than team rankings.\n\nThe imo has a rich history, having been held every year since its inception, except in 1980, when it was canceled due to internal strife in mongolia. Originally founded for eastern european countries in the warsaw pact, the competition has expanded, and now other countries participate as well. Several students have excelled in the imo, winning multiple gold medals, and some former participants have become notable mathematicians and won prestigious awards like the fields medal.\n\nThe imo exam consists of six problems, each worth seven points, with a maximum total score of 42 points. The examination takes place over two days, with students given four-and-a-half hours each day to solve three problems. Problems can be submitted by participating countries, and the imo jury, comprising team leaders, selects the final six problems. \n\n<user> How do countries select their teams for the imo? \n\n<assistant> The selection process for imo teams varies greatly between countries. In some countries, particularly in east asia, a rigorous selection process consists of several tests with a difficulty level comparable to the imo itself. For example, chinese contestants go through a selection camp.\n\nIn other countries, such as the united states, potential team members participate in a series of standalone competitions that progressively increase in difficulty. The selection process includes multiple stages, such as the american mathematics competitions (amc), the american invitational mathematics examination (aime), and the united states of america mathematical olympiad (usamo), all of which are competitions in their own right. High-scoring students in the final competition may also be invited to a summer camp, similar to that in china.\n\nOverall, the selection process in each country aims to identify the best-performing students to represent them at the imo, through either a series of increasingly difficult contests or an intensive training camp. \n\n<user> How has google supported the international mathematical olympiad? \n\n<assistant> In january 2011, google made a significant contribution to the international mathematical olympiad by donating €1 million to the imo organization. This generous donation helped cover the costs of the global events for the next five years (from 2011 to 2015). Google's support demonstrates the company's commitment to promoting mathematical excellence and nurturing young talent in the field of mathematics.\n\nCorporate sponsorship and donations, like google's, are important for international competitions like the imo to maintain their operations and continue inspiring and educating talented students. Besides the financial support, such backing also serves to raise awareness and recognition of the competition and may encourage more students to participate in mathematical activities and strive for success in such prestigious events.\n\nAs a technology company with a deep focus on innovation, research, and development, google is actively involved in various initiatives that promote stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education. Supporting the international mathematical olympiad is a natural extension of this commitment and an effective way to contribute to fostering the next generation of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers who may one day make a significant impact in their respective fields. \n\n<user> Can you provide more details about the problems and format of the examination? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The international mathematical olympiad (imo) examination consists of six problems, each worth seven points, making the maximum total score 42 points. No calculators or other electronic devices are allowed during the examination.\n\nThe examination takes place over two consecutive days. On each day, contestants have four-and-a-half hours to work on and solve three problems. The problems are drawn from various areas of secondary school mathematics such as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. These problems do not require knowledge of higher mathematics like calculus or analysis. In fact, solutions to the problems are often short and elementary in nature. However, the problems are formulated in a way that disguises their solutions, making them difficult to decipher and requiring a high level of ingenuity to solve.\n\nThe problems often feature algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, although construction problems have become less popular in recent years.\n\nEach participating country, other than the host country, may submit suggested problems to the problem selection committee, provided by the host country.

        "reference": " = International Mathematical Olympiad = \n\n The International Mathematical Olympiad ( IMO ) is an annual six-problem mathematical olympiad for pre-college students , and is the oldest of the International Science Olympiads \n The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959 \n It has since been held annually , except in 1980 \n About 100 countries send teams of up to six students , plus one team leader , one deputy leader , and observers \n \n\n The content ranges from extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered at school and often not at university level either , such as projective and complex geometry , functional equations and well-grounded number theory , of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required \n Calculus , though allowed in solutions , is never required , as there is a principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems , even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge \n Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant , deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity \n \n\n The selection process differs by country , but it often consists of a series of tests which admit fewer students at each progressing test \n Awards are given to the lowest percentage of the individual contestants \n Teams are not officially recognized — all scores are given only to individual contestants , but team scoring is unofficially compared more than individual scores \n Contestants must be under the age of 20 and must not be registered at any tertiary institution \n Subject to these conditions , an individual may participate any number of times in the IMO \n \n\n = = History = = \n\n The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959 \n Since then it has been held every year except in 1980 \n That year , it was cancelled due to internal strife in Mongolia \n It was initially founded for eastern European member countries of the Warsaw Pact , under the Soviet bloc of influence , but later other countries participated as well \n Because of this eastern origin , the IMOs were first hosted only in eastern European countries , and gradually spread to other nations \n \n\n Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs \n This may be partly because leaders are generally housed well away from the students , and partly because after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city for the rest of the IMO \n The exact dates cited may also differ , because of leaders arriving before the students , and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders \n \n\n Several students , such as Zhuoqun Alex Song , Teodor von Burg , Lisa Sauermann , and Christian Reiher , have performed exceptionally well in the IMO , winning multiple gold medals \n Others , such as Grigory Margulis , Jean-Christophe Yoccoz , Laurent Lafforgue , Stanislav Smirnov , Terence Tao , Sucharit Sarkar , Grigori Perelman , Ngô Bảo Châu and Maryam Mirzakhani have gone on to become notable mathematicians \n Several former participants have won awards such as the Fields Medal \n \n\n In January 2011 , Google gave € 1 million to the International Mathematical Olympiad organization \n The donation helped the organization cover the costs of the next five global events ( 2011 – 2015 ) \n \n\n = = Scoring and format = = \n\n The examination consists of six problems \n Each problem is worth seven points , so the maximum total score is 42 points \n No calculators are allowed \n The examination is held over two consecutive days \n each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems \n The problems chosen are from various areas of secondary school mathematics , broadly classifiable as geometry , number theory , algebra , and combinatorics \n They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis , and solutions are often short and elementary \n However , they are usually disguised so as to make the solutions difficult \n Prominently featured are algebraic inequalities , complex numbers , and construction-oriented geometrical problems , though in recent years the latter has not been as popular as before \n \n\n Each participating country , other than the host country , may submit suggested problems to a Problem Selection Committee provided by the host country , which reduces the submitted problems to a shortlist \n The team leaders arrive at the IMO a few days in advance of the contestants and form the IMO Jury which is responsible for all the formal decisions relating to the contest , starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlist \n The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1 , Q4 , Q2 , Q5 , Q3 and Q6 \n As the leaders know the problems in advance of the contestants , they are kept strictly separated and observed \n \n\n Each country 's marks are agreed between that country 's leader and deputy leader and coordinators provided by the host country ( the leader of the team whose country submitted the problem in the case of the marks of the host country ) , subject to the decisions of the chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolved \n \n\n = = Selection process = = \n\n The selection process for the IMO varies greatly by country \n In some countries , especially those in east Asia , the selection process involves several tests of a difficulty comparable to the IMO itself \n The Chinese contestants go through a camp \n In others , such as the USA , possible participants go through a series of easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficulty \n In the USA , the tests include the American Mathematics Competitions , the American Invitational Mathematics Examination , and the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad , each of which is a competition in its own right \n For high scorers in the final competition for the team selection , there also

Diagnosis is primarily through clinical examination; however, it is often difficult due to variation in expression. Some ocular complications include optic atrophy, myopia, and retinal coloboma. Early intervention through therapies and medical specialists can help manage symptoms. No known cure exists for cohen syndrome, but treatments like granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) can help manage some conditions such as neutropenia. Over the past several years, around 50 new cases have been reported worldwide, with cases in australia, new zealand, the uk, and the us. \n\n<user> What specific symptoms can be addressed by speech, physical, and occupational therapy in patients with cohen syndrome? \n\n<assistant> Speech, physical, and occupational therapy can be particularly beneficial for individuals with cohen syndrome by addressing various symptoms, depending on the individual's specific needs. Here are some examples of how these therapies can help:\n\n1. Speech therapy: for those experiencing speech and language delays, speech therapy can help improve articulation, receptive and expressive language skills, and overall communication abilities. This can be beneficial in addressing the intellectual disability aspect of the disorder.\n\n2. Physical therapy: physical therapy can help improve muscular strength, balance, and coordination in individuals with cohen syndrome, who may suffer from hypotonia (low muscle tone), joint overflexibility, and motor clumsiness. Regular physical therapy sessions can aid in increasing endurance, promoting proper body mechanics, and enhancing overall physical functioning.\n\n3. Occupational therapy: occupational therapy focuses on developing skills necessary for daily living and fostering independence. These skills may include self-care, feeding, dressing, grooming, and other activities crucial for a person's well-being. Occupational therapy can also help in addressing fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and sensory integration challenges that may be present in people with cohen syndrome.\n\nWhile not every person with cohen syndrome will benefit from all three therapies, a tailored and individualized approach determined by a professional assessment can provide the most effective support for managing and improving specific symptoms and challenges faced by patients with this condition. \n\n<user> Can you put it more simply? i want to know what kind of help people with cohen syndrome get to feel better and live a normal life. what do these different therapies do for them? \n\n<assistant> Sure! Cohen syndrome affects people in different ways, so the help they receive depends on their specific needs. There are three main types of therapy that can help them feel better:\n\n1. Speech therapy: helps improve how they talk and communicate with others, making it easier for them to express themselves.\n\n2. Physical therapy: helps with muscle strength and movement, so they can play, walk, and go about their daily activities more easily.\n\n3. Occupational therapy: teaches important life skills, like getting dressed and eating, so they can live more independently.\n\nThese therapies work together to help people with cohen syndrome have a better quality of life. The treatments they get are personalized, meaning each person gets the help they need based on their specific symptoms and challenges. By working with different therapists, patients can learn and practice important skills, which makes it easier for them to live a more normal life with cohen syndrome. ",

        "reference": "Cohen syndrome (also known as Pepper syndrome or Cervenka syndrome) is a very rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder with varied expression, characterised by obesity, intellectual disability, distinct craniofacial abnormalities and potential ocular dysfunction.\n\nGenetics \n\nThis syndrome is believed to be a gene mutation in chromosome 8 at locus 8q22 gene COH1. It has an autosomal recessive transmission with variable expression. There is evidence that this syndrome has a different mutation in the same gene as Mirhosseini–Holmes–Walton syndrome.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nCohen syndrome is diagnosed by clinical examination but is often difficult due to variation in expression. Ocular complications, though rare, are listed as optic atrophy, microphthalmia, pigmentary chorioretinitis, hemeralopia (decreased vision in bright light), myopia, strabismus, nystagmus and iris/retinal coloboma.\n\nGeneral appearance is obesity with thin/elongated arms and legs. micrognathia, short philtrum and high vaulted palate are common. Variable intellectual disability with occasional seizure and deafness also is characteristic of Cohen syndrome.\n\nManagement \nSome of the symptoms of Cohen syndrome can be addressed through early intervention with medical specialists. Those who have this disease may benefit from early exposure to speech, physical, and occupational therapy to correct symptoms such as joint overflexibility, developmental delays, hypotonia, and motor clumsiness. Diagnosis may potentially be delayed due to the lack of a definitive molecular test as well as the clinical variability of published case reports.\n\nGlasses are beneficial to those who have severe nearsightedness, whereas individuals with retinal degeneration need training for the visually impaired, which is usually more beneficial when this is addressed at a young age. Younger patients start out having unimpaired vision, but it starts to deteriorate at a young age and does so slowly. If vision is able to improve with the use of glasses, they should be worn to help facilitate concept development. Retinal degeneration cannot be ameliorated with glasses.\n\nThe type of therapy needed for each individual varies, as not every affected individual would benefit from speech, physical, and occupational therapies. The type of therapy for each person is highly individualized. Individuals who have Cohen syndrome may also benefit from psychosocial support.\n\nMany people who have Cohen syndrome also suffer from neutropenia which is a condition in which an individual has an abnormally low number of white blood cells called neutrophils. Having this condition may make these individuals susceptible to infections. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is one possible treatment for neutropenia.\n\nMonitoring weight gain and growth is crucial, as well as annual ophthalmologic and hematologic evaluations and checkups. While there are treatments available to people with Cohen syndrome, there are no known cures for the disease.\n\nPrevalence\n\nOver the past several years, there have been approximately 50 new cases worldwide. There are population groups with this condition in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the US.",

He also began working out daily, and later said he \"was born again\" after adopting these healthy habits. Although he faced ridicule and ostracism from his peers for his unconventional diet, he persisted in his pursuit of better health.\n\nLalanne eventually returned to school and made the high school football team. He went on to college in san francisco, where he earned a doctor of chiropractic degree. He studied henry gray's anatomy of the human body and concentrated on bodybuilding and weightlifting.

        "reference": "Francois Henri \"Jack\" LaLanne (; September 26, 1914January 23, 2011) was an American fitness and nutrition guru and motivational speaker. He described himself as being a \"sugarholic\" and a \"junk food junkie\" until he was age 15. He also had behavioral problems, but \"turned his life around\" after listening to a public lecture about the benefits of good nutrition by health food pioneer Paul Bragg. During his career, he came to believe that the country's overall health depended on the health of its population, and referred to physical culture and nutrition as \"the salvation of America.\"\n\nDecades before health and fitness began being promoted by celebrities like Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons, LaLanne was already widely recognized for publicly preaching the health benefits of regular exercise and a good diet. He published numerous books on fitness and hosted the fitness television program The Jack LaLanne Show from 1951 to 1985. As early as 1936, at age 21, he opened one of the nation's first fitness gyms in Oakland, California, which became a prototype for dozens of similar gyms bearing his name. One of his 1950s television exercise programs was aimed toward women, whom he also encouraged to join his health clubs. He invented a number of exercise machines, including the pulley and leg extension devices and the Smith machine. Besides producing his own series of videos, he coached the elderly and disabled not to forgo exercise, believing it would enable them to enhance their strength.\n\nLaLanne also gained recognition for his success as a bodybuilder, as well as for his prodigious feats of strength. Arnold Schwarzenegger once exclaimed \"That Jack LaLanne's an animal!\" after a 54-year-old LaLanne beat then 21-year-old Schwarzenegger in an informal contest. On the occasion of LaLanne's death, Schwarzenegger credited LaLanne for being \"an apostle for fitness\" by inspiring \"billions all over the world to live healthier lives,\" and, as governor of California, had earlier placed him on his Governor's Council on Physical Fitness. Steve Reeves credited LaLanne as his inspiration to build his muscular physique while keeping a slim waist.\n\nLaLanne was inducted into the California Hall of Fame and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEarly life\nLaLanne was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Jennie (née Garaig; 1882–1973) and Jean/John LaLanne (1881–1939), French immigrants from Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Both entered the U.S. in the 1880s as young children at the Port of New Orleans. LaLanne had two older brothers, Ervil, who died in childhood (1906–1911), and Norman (1908–2005), who nicknamed him \"Jack.\" He grew up in Bakersfield, California and later moved with his family to Berkeley, California circa 1928. In 1939, his father died at the age of 58 in a San Francisco hospital, which LaLanne attributed to \"coronary thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver.\" In his book The Jack LaLanne Way to Vibrant Health, LaLanne wrote that as a boy he was addicted to sugar and junk food. He had violent episodes directed against himself and others, describing himself as \"a miserable kid ... it was like hell.\"\n\nBesides having a bad temper, LaLanne also suffered from headaches and bulimia, and temporarily dropped out of high school at age 14. The following year, at age 15, he heard health food pioneer Paul Bragg give a talk on health and nutrition, focusing on the \"evils of meat and sugar.\" Bragg's message had a powerful influence on LaLanne, who then changed his life and started focusing on his diet and exercise. In his own words, he was \"born again,\" and besides his new focus on nutrition, he began working out daily (although while serving during World War II as a Pharmacist Mate First Class at the Sun Valley Naval Convalescent Hospital, LaLanne stated that he started in bodybuilding at \"age 13\"). Describing his change of diet, LaLanne stated, \"I had to take my lunch alone to the football field to eat so no one would see me eat my raw veggies, whole bread, raisins and nuts. You don't know the crap I went through.\"\n\nWriter Hal Reynolds, who interviewed LaLanne in 2008, notes that he became an avid swimmer and trained with weights; he described his introduction to weight lifting thus:\n\nLaLanne went back to school, where he made the high school football team, and later went on to college in San Francisco where he earned a Doctor of Chiropractic degree. He studied Henry Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body and concentrated on bodybuilding and weightlifting.\n\nFitness career\n\nHealth clubs\nIn 1936, he opened the nation's first health and fitness club in Oakland, California, where he offered supervised weight and exercise training and gave nutritional advice. His primary goal was to encourage and motivate his clients to improve their overall health. Doctors, however, advised their patients to stay away from his health club, a business totally unheard of at the time, and warned their patients that \"LaLanne was an exercise 'nut,' whose programs would make them 'muscle-bound' and cause severe medical problems.\" LaLanne recalls the initial reaction of doctors to his promotion of weight-lifting:\n\nLaLanne designed the first leg extension machines, pulley machines using cables, and the weight selectors that are now standard in the fitness industry. He invented the original model of what became the Smith machine. LaLanne encouraged women to lift weights (though at the time it was thought this would make women look masculine and unattractive). By the 1980s, Jack LaLanne's European Health Spas numbered more than 200. He eventually licensed all his health clubs to the Bally company, now known as Bally Total Fitness.  Though not associated with any gym, LaLanne continued to lift weights until his death.\n\nLaLanne's gym ownership led to a brief professional wrestling career in 1938.  Wrestlers were among the few athletes who embraced weight training, and they frequented his health club. LaLanne wrestled in the Bay Area for only a few months. He was well respected enough that he was booked to wrestle to a draw against some big name opponents rather than lose, despite his lack of experience. According to Ad Santel's grandson David Ad Santel, LaLanne wanted to be a champion from the start, but did not have the wrestling skills to do so. LaLanne was also friendly with such performers as Lou Thesz and Strangler Lewis.\n\nBooks, television and other media\n\nLaLanne presented fitness and exercise advice on television for 34 years. The Jack LaLanne Show was the longest-running television exercise program.  According to the SF Chronicle TV program archives, it first began on 28 September 1953 as a 15-minute local morning program (sandwiched between the morning news and a cooking show) on San Francisco's ABC television station, KGO-TV, with LaLanne paying for the airtime himself as a way to promote his gym and related health products.  LaLanne also met his wife Elaine while she was working for the local station.  In 1959, the show was picked up for nationwide syndication, and continued until 1985.\n\nThe show was noted for its minimalist set, where LaLanne inspired his viewers to use basic home objects, such as a chair, to perform their exercises along with him. Wearing his standard jumpsuit, he urged his audience \"with the enthusiasm of an evangelist,\" to get off their couch and copy his basic movements, a manner considered the forerunner of today's fitness videos. In 1959, LaLanne recorded Glamour Stretcher Time, a workout album that provided phonograph-based instruction for exercising with an elastic cord called the Glamour Stretcher.  As a daytime show, much of LaLanne's audience were stay-at-home mothers.",

        "reference": "Perfect World (, commonly abbreviated as PW and W2), is a 3D adventure and fantasy MMORPG with traditional Chinese settings. Players can take on various roles depending on choice of race and choice of class within that race.\n\nCharacters develop skills over time with experience and level up via questing rewards and can use and upgrade physical and magical weapons, and team up with other players to fight against monsters in instances, bosses on the open world as well as other players. Very often, people will sell their accounts which saves buying the items from the in game cash shop, farming experience and gaining the skills needed. This option is ideal after the removal of most PvE coin making methods due to PW now being focused on PvP paying players.\n\nEach player can join a guild (if accepted) and thereby be part of a 200 maximum player base with common goals to achieve. The PW map is broken into a large number of territories which gives guilds an option to conquer and govern such territories via Territory War for reward of ownership usually in the form of coins which are used back to benefit the guild and its players.\n\nTerritory War is 80 players VS 80 players, strategic battle which has a 3-hour maximum time cap with each class belonging to a race having unique roles to perform and teamwork and strategy is key to sustain victory.  On the US version of PW, Territory War time cap was reduced to 1 hour 40 minutes due to the low player base numbers and low number of players attending. Currently, there is no real emphasis from the player base towards participating in Territory War due to useless rewards. Certain factions still choose to attend however, but most of the fights are completed in 15/20 mins due to other factions not being interested. Twilight Temple and Dawnglory servers currently have the most competitive Territory War seasons followed by Tideswell and then Etherblade server, which the latter has only had 1 faction intent on winning Territory Wars over the past few seasons.\n\nPerfect World is heavily based on Chinese mythology and is set in the mythical world of Pangu. It was launched in January 2006.\n\nPerfect World Boutique/Item Mall\n\nWhile Perfect World states it is free-to-play, in order to have a chance to compete and experience the game fully, substantial amounts of money are needed. The game relies on items sold in an in-game cash shop to make profit. Use of the cash shop is optional, but most items purchased there are required to improve a player's gameplay, while few items have purely cosmetic functions.\n\nCurrency used in the cash shop can be bought from the respective websites of each company running a version of the game. Alternatively, cash shop currency can be bought in the auction house from other players in exchange for in-game currency.\n\nPerfect World International offers pre-charged cards that can be bought from 7-Eleven, Target, and GameStop locations. The Malaysian version allows a player to \"Top Up\" via CubiCards. Players may also use other payment forms such as Ultimate Game Cards to purchase cash shop currency by using the PayByCash option.\n\nPhone Lock System\n\nAs a prevention system against account hackers, Perfect World has a Phone Lock feature for those who wish to use it. The Phone Lock, when activated, will freeze an account until the player of that account dials in using the registered phone number. Once the number is recognized, the account is temporarily activated for login. The player must login within 10 minutes of activation before the account login is frozen again. The player may continue to play despite the freeze. If the player logs out after the 10 minutes are up, that player must once again dial in to temporarily deactivate the Phone Lock.

Its development had the purpose of combining cabernet sauvignon's superior quality with carignan's heat resistance to produce an affordable table wine. While it doesn't possess the same distinctive flavor as other types of cabernet wines, it carries their fruitful essence.\n\nIt was developed for california's hot climate, specifically in the san joaquin and napa valleys. As a result, ruby cabernet has improved the quality of bulk wines produced in these areas, thanks to its unique acidity.\n\nSome of the wine regions where ruby cabernet is grown include argentina, australia, brazil, mexico, chile, israel, south africa, and the united states. The grapes have a good color and a pleasant cherry flavor, typically blended into bulk wines. Depending on farming techniques used, it can produce wines with exceptional aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel. The vine is drought resistant and tolerates high winds. \n\n<user> It's interesting to see how different countries cultivate ruby cabernet. can you provide some examples of wineries or vineyards in these regions that are known for producing ruby cabernet wines? and are there any specific recommendations for improving the vineyard conditions to maximize the quality of the grapes and the wine? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! In different regions, some notable examples of wineries and vineyards producing ruby cabernet are as follows:\n\n1. Brazil: vale do são francisco winery in pernambuco (produces botticelli coleção ruby cabernet) and vinícola campos de cima in itaqui, campanha gaúcha (produces a 100% varietal ruby cabernet).\n2. Mexico: valle de guadalupe in baja california (produces cabernet franc - malbec/ruby cabernet); aguascalientes is another region with wines featuring ruby cabernet.\n3. Israel: tishbi winery in zichron ya'akov uses ruby cabernet.\n4. South africa: van loveren \"river red\" blend contains ruby cabernet, grown in the successful robertson district.\n5. United states: ruby cabernet is mainly planted in california's san joaquin valley.\n\nTo maximize the quality of ruby cabernet grapes and wine, vineyards should limit irrigation, thin crop, and expose fruit to the sun, especially in california's san joaquin valley. This approach will enhance the wine's aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel. \n\n<user> What are some of the challenges that ruby cabernet faces in different regions, like south africa, for example? also, could you explain more about the vineyard ground requirements and the vine's characteristics, such as drought resistance and high wind tolerance? \n\n<assistant> One of the challenges ruby cabernet faces in south africa is poor fruit set, which has limited its success in the region. It is also vulnerable to powdery mildew, a fungal disease affecting grapevines.\n\nThe vine of ruby cabernet is notably drought-resistant, meaning it can thrive with limited water supply. This characteristic makes it suitable for regions with hot and dry climates, like california or south africa. Its high wind tolerance allows it to withstand strong gusts, making it adaptable to various vineyard conditions.\n\nFor optimal growth, ruby cabernet vineyards should be situated on vigorous grounds with deep clay loam. The canopy should be open and not completely erected, which ensures better sunlight exposure and air circulation. The spacing beneath the vineyard row is typically around 7-8 feet for vertical shoot positioning, while horizontally divided quadrilateral vineyards require a spacing of about 6-7 feet.\n\nProviding the right conditions for the vine will greatly contribute to the overall quality of the ruby cabernet grapes and the wines they produce. By considering factors like drought resistance, wind tolerance, and proper ground requirements, ruby cabernet can be cultivated to produce enjoyable and affordable table wines. \n\n<user> If i want to try a ruby cabernet wine, which wineries or vineyards would you recommend for a high-quality ruby cabernet varietal or blend, and where can i find them? \n\n<assistant> To experience a high-quality ruby cabernet varietal or blend, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Brazil: vinícola campos de cima in itaqui, campanha gaúcha produces a 100% varietal of the wine ruby cabernet.\n2. Brazil: vale do são francisco winery in pernambuco produces botticelli coleção ruby cabernet.\n3. Australia: andrew mcpherson in victoria uses ruby cabernet in several export wines like full fifteen, which they export to england and denmark.\n4. Mexico: valle de guadalupe in baja california offers cabernet franc - malbec/ruby cabernet.\n5. United states: ruby cabernet wines from california, particularly from the san joaquin valley, can produce standout wines when employing proper farming techniques.\n\nTo find these wines, you can search online retailers that specialize in international wines or visit local wine shops and inquire about availability. If feasible, consider contacting the wineries directly or looking for distributors and retailers carrying their products in your area.\n\nIn addition, attending wine-tasting events or visiting wine bars that offer diverse selections might help you discover high-quality ruby cabernet wines.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I came across the concept of transdermal drug administration and found it fascinating. challenges and obstacles faced in this route of administration? how do drugs pass through the skin? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Transdermal drug administration involves delivering active ingredients across the skin for systemic distribution. The main obstacle faced in this route is the skin's natural protective function which makes it difficult for drugs to penetrate. There are two important layers to the human skin: the epidermis and the dermis. For successful transdermal delivery, drugs must pass through the sublayers of the epidermis to reach the dermis' microcirculation.\n\nThe stratum corneum, the top layer of the skin, is the most significant barrier to diffusion. It comprises layers of dead, flattened keratinocytes surrounded by a lipid matrix, forming a brick-and-mortar system that is difficult to penetrate. However, nearly all molecules can penetrate it to some minimal degree. In contrast, the sublayer below the stratum corneum, called the viable epidermis, has greater hydration in its living cells, making diffusion faster.\n\nThere are two primary pathways for drugs to cross the skin and enter systemic circulation: the transcellular pathway and the intercellular pathway. In the transcellular pathway, drugs pass through the phospholipid membranes and the cytoplasm of the dead keratinocytes in the stratum corneum, facing significant resistance due to the alternating lipophilic and hydrophilic environments. In the intercellular pathway, drugs pass through the small spaces between the skin cells. Although this route is more tortuous, it is more common. \n\n<user> Thanks for the explanation! if the skin's protective function is an obstacle, how do transdermal patches help overcome these challenges to deliver the drugs? \n\n<assistant> Transdermal patches overcome the challenges of skin penetration by employing various techniques to enhance drug delivery. Some of the strategies include:\n\n1. Chemical enhancers: these are substances added to the formulation to increase the skin's permeability. They can improve drug delivery by interacting with the stratum corneum's lipids, leading to increased drug diffusion.\n\n2. Physical methods: techniques like iontophoresis, electroporation, and sonophoresis use electrical or mechanical energy to create transient pathways in the stratum corneum or enhance drug penetration through existing pathways.\n\n3. Micro-needles: these are tiny needles that pierce the stratum corneum and create micro-channels, allowing the drug to bypass the main barrier and directly enter the viable epidermis or the dermis.\n\n4. Occlusion: this involves covering the application area with an impermeable material to increase hydration of the skin, thereby increasing its permeability to the drug.\n\n5. Optimizing drug properties: altering the drug's chemical structure or formulation can help optimize its lipophilicity and molecular size, making it more suitable for transdermal delivery.\n\nThese methods aid in overcoming the skin's protective function, allowing drugs to penetrate the skin more effectively and reach the systemic circulation. However, not all drugs are suitable for transdermal delivery. Factors like molecular size, lipophilicity, and required dosage play a role in determining whether a drug can be successfully administered through a transdermal patch. \n\n<user> That's really interesting. how are drugs selected for transdermal administration, and when is this route considered advantageous? \n\n<assistant> The selection of drugs for transdermal administration depends on several factors, such as physicochemical properties, therapeutic intent, and patient considerations. Here are some key factors influencing drug selection:\n\n1. Molecular size: smaller molecules tend to penetrate the skin more effectively. Generally, drugs with a molecular mass less than 500 da are suitable for transdermal delivery.\n\n2. Lipophilicity: an ideal drug for transdermal administration should have balanced lipophilicity (logp value between 1 and 4) to overcome the skin's lipophilic and hydrophilic environments.\n\n3. Drug potency: since the transdermal route typically allows lower amounts of drug to enter systemic circulation, drugs with high potency and low dosage requirements are suitable candidates.\n\n4. Therapeutic window: drugs with a narrow therapeutic window might not be suitable for transdermal devices, as the risk of adverse effects from inconsistent dosing increases.\n\nTransdermal administration can be advantageous in several situations:\n\n1. Avoiding gastrointestinal issues: some drugs cause gastric irritation or are poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Transdermal administration can bypass these issues.\n\n2. Steady drug levels: transdermal patches release drugs at a controlled rate, maintaining steady drug levels in the bloodstream and minimizing fluctuations.\n\n3. Improved patient adherence: transdermal patches are convenient and can allow for less frequent dosing, which may improve patient adherence to the treatment.\n\n4. Avoiding first-pass metabolism: some drugs undergo significant degradation in the liver, reducing their bioavailability. Transdermal administration bypasses the liver, increasing the drug's effectiveness.\n\n5. Tailoring drug delivery: drug release rates and the duration of action can be controlled in transdermal patches, allowing for tailored treatment options.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider each case individually, as not all drugs or patients are suitable for transdermal administration, and some conditions might require other routes of delivery.

Examples include transdermal patches used for medicine delivery.\nThe drug is administered in the form of a patch or ointment that delivers the drug into the circulation for systemic effect.\n\nTechniques\n\nObstacles\nAlthough the skin is a large and logical target for drug delivery, its basic functions limit its utility for this purpose.  The skin functions mainly to protect the body from external penetration (by e.g. harmful substances and microorganisms) and to contain all body fluids.  \n\nThere are two important layers to the human skin: (1) the Epidermis and (2) the Dermis.  For transdermal delivery, drugs must pass through the two sublayers of the epidermis to reach the microcirculation of the dermis.\n\nThe Stratum corneum is the top layer of the skin and varies in thickness from approximately ten to several hundred micrometres, depending on the region of the body. It is composed of layers of dead, flattened keratinocytes surrounded by a lipid matrix, which together act as a brick-and-mortar system that is difficult to penetrate.\n\nThe stratum corneum provides the most significant barrier to diffusion. In fact, the stratum corneum is the barrier to approximately 90% of transdermal drug applications. However, nearly all molecules penetrate it to some minimal degree.  Below the stratum corneum lies the viable epidermis.  This layer is about ten times as thick as the stratum corneum; however, diffusion is much faster here due to the greater degree of hydration in the living cells of the viable epidermis.  Below the epidermis lies the dermis, which is approximately one millimeter thick, 100 times the thickness of the stratum corneum.  The dermis contains small vessels that distribute drugs into the systemic circulation and to regulate temperature, a system known as the skin's microcirculation.\n\nTransdermal pathways\nThere are two main pathways by which drugs can cross the skin and reach the systemic circulation.  The more direct route is known as the transcellular pathway.\n\nTranscellular pathway\nBy this route, drugs cross the skin by directly passing through both the phospholipids membranes and the cytoplasm of the dead keratinocytes that constitute the stratum corneum.\n\nAlthough this is the path of shortest distance, the drugs encounter significant resistance to permeation. This resistance is caused because the drugs must cross the lipophilic membrane of each cell, then the hydrophilic cellular contents containing keratin, and then the phospholipid bilayer of the cell one more time. This series of steps is repeated numerous times to traverse the full thickness of the stratum corneum.\n\nIntercellular pathway\nThe other more common pathway through the skin is via the intercellular route.  Drugs crossing the skin by this route must pass through the small spaces between the cells of the skin, making the route more tortuous.  Although the thickness of the stratum corneum is only about 20 µm, the actual diffusional path of most molecules crossing the skin is on the order of 400 µm.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Kakapo parrot? \n\n<assistant> The kakapo, also known as the owl parrot, is a unique species of large, flightless, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot native to new zealand. One of the most unusual features of the kakapo is its appearance. It has yellow-green plumage with fine blotches, a distinct facial disc of sensory, vibrissa-like feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large feet, and relatively short wings and tail.\n\nThe kakapo is in a league of its own when it comes to parrots, as it boasts several distinct qualities. For example, it is the only flightless parrot in the world, the heaviest, nocturnal, herbivorous, possesses visible sexual dimorphism in body size, a low basal metabolic rate, no male parental care, and is the only parrot species to have a polygynous lek breeding system. Additionally, it might be one of the world's longest-living birds.\n\nThis fascinating bird's anatomy represents the typical evolution found on oceanic islands, where predators are scarce, and food is abundant. The kakapo's robust physique provides thermodynamic efficiency at the expense of flight abilities, which includes reduced wing muscles and a diminished keel on the sternum.\n\nThe māori, the indigenous people of new zealand, have long held the kakapo in high regard. The bird has appeared in numerous legends and folklore. The māori not only hunted kakapos for their meat but also used their feathers to craft valuable garments. Some māori even kept kakapos as pets.\n\nToday, the kakapo is critically endangered. As of march 2014, the known population was only 123 individuals, which the kakapo recovery programme closely monitors. The introduction of predators such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats due to polynesian and european colonization led to the species nearly becoming extinct. Kakapo conservation efforts began in the 1890s, gaining more significant success with the implementation of the kakapo recovery plan in the 1980s. The remaining kakapo are kept on three predator-free islands - codfish, anchor, and little barrier islands, where they are closely monitored. \n\n<user> How does their breeding system work? \n\n<assistant> The kakapo has a unique breeding system called a polygynous lek breeding system. In this system, male kakapos gather in designated areas called \"leks\" to attract and mate with multiple females. The males are in direct competition with each other over mates and use display areas within the lek to perform vocalizations and visual displays.\n\nTo attract females, male kakapos perform a low-frequency \"booming\" call, which can be heard up to several kilometers away. The males inflate their thoracic air sacs, create a deep resonant sound, and emit this call periodically throughout the night. The primary purpose of the booming is to alert nearby females of their presence, and frequently these calls are accompanied by rhythmic movements, wing-flapping, and even use of nearby vegetation for amplification.\n\nFemales can visit multiple leks before choosing a male with whom to mate. Once she chooses a male, the female kakapo mates with him and then raises the offspring on her own without any assistance from the male. In this system, the main goal of the male is to maximize his mating opportunities, while the female focuses on selecting the best possible mate for her offspring.\n\nThe breeding season for kakapos is not regular, as it depends on the availability of food, especially the native new zealand rimu tree, which produces fruit in a 2-4 year cycle. When food is abundant, the kakapo population experiences higher breeding rates. For instance, during the 2016 breeding season, 34 chicks fledged, raising the total population to 157. \n\n<user> How can i help with kakapo conservation? \n\n<assistant> Participating in kakapo conservation is a noble endeavor, and there are several ways you can contribute to the cause. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Donate: you can donate to organizations committed to kakapo conservation like the kakapo recovery programme. Your contributions will aid in funding research, habitat restoration, and predator control initiatives.\n\n2. Spread awareness: educate others about the kakapo and its plight by sharing information on social media or in your community. Raising awareness can generate support and understanding for the conservation efforts.\n\n3. Responsible tourism: if you ever visit new zealand, consider visiting conservation sites or initiatives, but be mindful of your actions to protect the fragile ecosystem. You may learn more about the efforts on the ground and share your experiences with others in your travels.\n\n4. Support local organizations: you can support organizations working on wildlife conservation in general, as their efforts may indirectly help to conserve the kakapo habitat and related species.\n\n5. Adopt eco-friendly habits: reduce your environmental impact and promote conservation through sustainable living choices, like recycling, reducing waste, and supporting green initiatives.\n\nRemember, every positive action counts, and your contributions, no matter how small they seem, can add up to make a significant difference in conserving the kakapo and other endangered species.

        "current_turn": "<user> Kakapo parrot? \n\n<assistant> The kakapo, also known as the owl parrot, is a unique species of large, flightless, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot native to new zealand. One of the most unusual features of the kakapo is its appearance. It has yellow-green plumage with fine blotches, a distinct facial disc of sensory, vibrissa-like feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large feet, and relatively short wings and tail.\n\nThe kakapo is in a league of its own when it comes to parrots, as it boasts several distinct qualities. For example, it is the only flightless parrot in the world, the heaviest, nocturnal, herbivorous, possesses visible sexual dimorphism in body size, a low basal metabolic rate, no male parental care, and is the only parrot species to have a polygynous lek breeding system. Additionally, it might be one of the world's longest-living birds.\n\nThis fascinating bird's anatomy represents the typical evolution found on oceanic islands, where predators are scarce, and food is abundant. The kakapo's robust physique provides thermodynamic efficiency at the expense of flight abilities, which includes reduced wing muscles and a diminished keel on the sternum.\n\nThe māori, the indigenous people of new zealand, have long held the kakapo in high regard. The bird has appeared in numerous legends and folklore. The māori not only hunted kakapos for their meat but also used their feathers to craft valuable garments. Some māori even kept kakapos as pets.\n\nToday, the kakapo is critically endangered. As of march 2014, the known population was only 123 individuals, which the kakapo recovery programme closely monitors. The introduction of predators such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats due to polynesian and european colonization led to the species nearly becoming extinct. Kakapo conservation efforts began in the 1890s, gaining more significant success with the implementation of the kakapo recovery plan in the 1980s.

State of washington. It serves communities in southern king county, providing an important transportation route in the region. The highway follows the kent-des moines road and kent-kangley road, traveling east from a concurrency with sr 509 in des moines through kent and covington, and finally reaching an intersection with sr 169 in maple valley.\n\nSr 516 has several major intersections with key freeways in the area, such as interstate 5 (i-5) in western kent, sr 167 in downtown kent, and sr 18 in covington. The road was originally built in the 1890s and was officially designated as two separate highways (secondary state highway 1k and 5a) in 1937. The two highways were later combined during the 1964 highway renumbering to form sr 516 along its current route.\n\nParts of sr 516 within western kent, specifically between i-5 and sr 167, are recognized as part of the national highway system. This recognition is given to roadways that hold significant importance to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nAccording to the washington state department of transportation's (wsdot) annual average daily traffic (aadt) surveys conducted in 2011, the busiest section of sr 516 lies between sr 181 and the sr 167 interchange, catering to 38,000 vehicles, while the least busy section consists of its western terminus at sr 509, serving 8,900 vehicles. \n\n<user> What are some prominent landmarks or locations along sr 516? \n\n<assistant> Washington state route 516 passes through several important locations and landmarks as it traverses multiple communities in southern king county. Here are some of the key places you'll find along the route:\n\n1. Marine view drive: sr 516 begins at marine view drive in des moines as sr 509 turns north towards burien near the east passage of puget sound.\n\n2. Highline community college: heading east, sr 516 passes by highline community college in des moines.\n\n3. Mount rainier high school: the highway also passes mount rainier high school before reaching an intersection with sr 99 in western kent.\n\n4. Interstate 5 (i-5): sr 516 intersects i-5 at a partial cloverleaf interchange in western kent. Following the interchange, sr 516 continues as a four-lane divided highway.\n\n5. Green river and its pedestrian and bicycle trail: as sr 516 crosses the green river, it also spans the pedestrian and bicycle trail that follows the river.\n\n6. Downtown kent: the highway plays a crucial role in serving downtown kent, where it functions as the southern terminus of sr 181 before intersecting sr 167. The interchange with sr 167 is a diamond one located at the western edge of downtown kent.\n\n7. Interurban trail: as sr 516 veers south onto willis street, it crosses the interurban trail—a popular regional walking and biking path.\n\n8. Bnsf rail line: sr 516 crosses a bnsf rail line as it progresses east through the city of kent.\n\n9. Kent station: the highway turns north onto central avenue and east onto smith street near kent station, a major transit hub for the area.\n\n10. Kent-meridian high school: as sr 516 travels southeast along mill creek onto the kent-kangley road, it serves as the southern terminus of sr 515 at kent-meridian high school before exiting the city limits of kent.\n\n11. Covington: in covington, sr 516 follows 272nd street and passes lake meridian. It then intersects sr 18 at a diamond interchange located in the city.\n\n12. Pipe lake: east of covington, the highway continues past pipe lake and eventually enters maple valley.\n\n13. Cedar to green river trail: in maple valley, sr 516 crosses the cedar to green river trail, another regional walking and biking path.\n\n14. Sr 169 intersection: the eastern terminus of sr 516 is located in maple valley, where it intersects with sr 169.\n\nThese landmarks and locations contribute to the importance of sr 516 as a primary transportation route connecting several communities, commercial areas, educational institutions, and recreational facilities. \n\n<user> When was the kent-kangley road built? \n\n<assistant> The kent-kangley road, which forms a part of washington state route 516, was initially constructed as a wagon road by king county in the late 1890s. It served as an essential transportation route for local communities during that time.\n\nLater, in 1937, the route was upgraded to a paved highway when it was officially designated as two separate highways—secondary state highway 1k (ssh 1k) and secondary state highway 5a (ssh 5a)—during the creation of the primary and secondary state highways system. These separate designations focused on distinct sections of the route; ssh 1k covered the portion from des moines to kent, while ssh 5a spanned from kent to maple valley.\n\nThe two highways were eventually combined in the 1964 highway renumbering, leading to the formation of the current sr 516. This consolidation brought about a more unified and efficient highway system, further improving the transportation infrastructure linking communities in southern king county. \n\n<user> Sr 509's realignment in 1991? \n\n<assistant> In 1991, washington state route 509 (sr 509) underwent a realignment that affected its routing in conjunction with sr 516 and sr 99. Before the realignment, sr 509 had its own separate path. However, during the realignment, sr 509 was placed onto the same route as sr 516 and sr 99, creating new concurrencies between these highways. This means that, for a portion of their lengths, sr 509, sr 516, and sr 99 shared a single roadway.\n\nThe realignment served as a temporary measure while plans were underway for the completion of a new north-south freeway. Once the new freeway was constructed, sr 509 would be moved to follow this new route, eliminating the concurrency with sr 516 and sr 99.\n\nThe purpose of the realignment was to improve traffic flow, enhance safety, and increase efficiency along the highways, especially in areas with high traffic volumes or frequent congestion. Realignment projects such as this one are part of broader transportation initiatives aimed at optimizing and updating roadway infrastructure to better serve the evolving needs of drivers and communities.

Indiana has a rich history ranging from the native american era to its early european settlers and motor racing. There are a total of 43 national historic landmarks (nhls) in indiana, which are distributed across 23 of its 92 counties. The landmarks reflect indiana's industrial and architectural heritage, as well as various themes like battles, circuses, education, and more. The nhls can be categorized based on their significance: one landmark has military importance, fourteen are architecturally significant, nine are associated with noteworthy historical figures, and one is an archaeological site.\n\nThese landmarks are managed by the national park service, which is a branch of the department of the interior. The national park service identifies properties that fulfill nhl criteria and recommends them for nomination after an owner notification process. Both public and privately owned properties can receive nhl designation, which provides partial protection and support for these historic sites through tax incentives, grants, and other means. It's worth noting that all nhls are also included on the national register of historic places (nrhp), but nhls are considered nationally significant, while other nrhp properties are of local or state-level significance. \n\n<user> That's really interesting! are there any counties in indiana with a particularly high concentration of these landmarks? and are any architects famous for designing more than one of these landmarks? \n\n<assistant> Yes, certain indiana counties have a higher concentration of national historic landmarks. Marion county, which is home to the state capital, indianapolis, has the most nhls, with ten in total. Bartholomew county follows with seven landmarks, and jefferson county has four. Twenty other counties have one nhl each, while the remaining 69 counties in indiana do not have any nhls.\n\nAs for architects, three of them have designed multiple indiana nhls, making them particularly notable in the state's architectural history. These architects are francis costigan, william dentzel, and eero saarinen. Their designs significantly contribute to indiana's unique architectural identity and help to showcase the various styles and eras that have shaped the state. \n\n<user> I've heard there are some large historic areas in indiana as well, known as national historic landmark districts. can you provide more information about them and maybe some examples? \n\n<assistant> Certainly!

These districts cover larger areas and encompass multiple historic sites, buildings, or structures within their boundaries, adding significance to the state's heritage.\n\nAmong these districts, the Madison Historic District is a prime example. It includes two National Historic Landmarks within its territory – the Lanier Mansion and the Charles L. Shrewsbury House. These sites are part of the broader district, which collectively represents the historical, cultural, and architectural significance of the area.\n\nNHL Districts, like the Madison Historic District, contribute to a more in-depth understanding of Indiana's history by examining the relationships between various landmarks and the communities that have grown around them. These districts offer a holistic perspective on the state's development and the factors that played a role in shaping its identity. \n\n<user> Could you please provide a few examples of famous national historic landmarks in indiana? \n\n<assistant> Sure! Some well-known national historic landmarks in indiana include:\n\n1. Lanier mansion: this greek revival-style mansion in madison, indiana, was built in 1844 and was once the home of wealthy banker and railroad financier james lanier.\n\n2. Charles l.

The Secretary of the Interior reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation. Both public and privately owned properties can be designated as NHLs. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means. Owners may object to the nomination of the property as a NHL. When this is the case the Secretary of the Interior can only designate a site as eligible for designation.\n\nAll NHLs are also included on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a list of historic properties that the National Park Service deems to be worthy of preservation. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, while other NRHP properties are deemed significant at the local or state level. The NHLs in Indiana comprise approximately 2% of the 1,656 properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana as of December 2009.  The landmarks are among the most important nationally recognized historic sites in the state; the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park is one other site that has high designation by the Federal government.\n\nMarion County, the location of the state capital Indianapolis, has the most NHLs, with ten, followed by Bartholomew County with seven and Jefferson County with four. Twenty counties have one, while the other 69 counties of Indiana have none. Indiana's first NHL was designated on October 9, 1960. Architects who designed multiple Indiana NHLs are Francis Costigan, William Dentzel, and Eero Saarinen.\n\nEight Historic Landmarks in Indiana are more specifically designated National Historic Landmark Districts, meaning that they cover a large area rather than a single building. The Lanier Mansion and Charles L. Shrewsbury House are within the boundaries of the Madison Historic District.\n\nKey\n\nNational Historical Landmarks\n\n|}\n\nNational Historic Landmarks formerly in Indiana\n\nSee also\nList of U.S. National Historic Landmarks by state\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Indiana\nHistoric preservation\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nNational Historic Landmarks Program at the National Park Service\n\nIndiana\n \nNational Historic Landmarks\nNational Historic Landmarks",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I've been experiencing muscle weakness and skin rashes lately. can you provide more information about these symptoms and what condition they might be associated with? \n\n<assistant> Your symptoms could be indicative of a condition called dermatomyositis (dm). This is a long-term inflammatory disorder that affects skin and muscles. The main symptoms include a skin rash and worsening muscle weakness over time, which may occur suddenly or develop over months. The skin rash could be purplish, red, or lilac and appear around the eyes, on the upper chest or back, and other areas like the upper arms, thighs, or hands. Gottron's sign, which involves red or violet papules, may also be present on finger joints or other bony prominences.\n\nOther possible symptoms of dm include weight loss, fever, lung inflammation, or light sensitivity. Complications might involve calcium deposits in muscles or skin. Although the exact cause is unknown, theories suggest it could be an autoimmune disease or the result of a viral infection. Dermatomyositis might also develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome related to various cancers. To diagnose this condition, a combination of symptoms, blood tests, electromyography, and muscle biopsies are typically used.\n\nIf you are concerned about these symptoms, it is important to consult a healthcare professional to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatments usually improve symptoms and can consist of medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics and assistive devices, and rest. \n\n<user> What treatments are commonly prescribed? \n\n<assistant> For dermatomyositis, the treatment plan usually involves medications, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics, and rest to help manage symptoms and improve the condition. The most common medications prescribed for dm are corticosteroids, which help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. If steroids are not working well, other agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be recommended. Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) may help improve the outcomes for some patients.\n\nThe physical therapy goals typically include increasing muscle strength, maintaining flexibility, and improving overall function. Therapeutic exercises are designed to address the specific muscle groups affected by this condition. Heat therapy can help relieve muscle pain and stiffness, and orthotics or assistive devices, like canes, walkers, or braces, can be utilized for better support and mobility. Adequate rest is also crucial as it allows the body to recover from the inflammation.\n\nIt is essential to work with a healthcare professional to develop a personalized treatment plan based on individual needs and specific symptoms. \n\n<user> Are certain people at a higher risk for developing dermatomyositis? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are certain factors that may increase an individual's risk of developing dermatomyositis. The condition usually affects people in their 40s and 50s. Interestingly, women are more likely to be affected than men. However, people of any age may develop dm, including children and the elderly.\n\nCertain cases of the condition may also be linked with an individual's genetic makeup. Hla subtypes, such as hla-dr3, hla-dr52, and hla-dr6, have been associated with a predisposition to autoimmune dermatomyositis. Another known risk factor is its association with malignancy. This condition can develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome in relation to various forms of cancer, including ovarian, breast, and lung cancers. The risk of developing malignancy in association with dermatomyositis increases after age 60.\n\nIt is essential to be aware of these risk factors and to consult with a healthcare professional if you experience any persistent symptoms associated with dm. \n\n<user> How can i manage to live a normal life while dealing with dermatomyositis? \n\n<assistant> Living with dermatomyositis can be challenging, but there are ways to manage the condition and maintain a good quality of life. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Collaboration with healthcare professionals: work closely with your doctors, therapists, and specialists to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and helps control symptoms.\n\n2. Medication adherence: follow your prescribed medication schedule and always consult your doctor before making any changes.\n\n3. Exercise and physical therapy: regularly participate in physical therapy and appropriate exercise routines, as these can help maintain muscle strength, flexibility, and overall function.\n\n4. Heat therapy: consider using heat therapy to alleviate muscle pain and stiffness.\n\n5. Assistive devices: utilize orthotics and assistive devices that can improve mobility and provide support, like canes, walkers, or braces.\n\n6. Rest: ensure that you get adequate rest, as it allows your body to recover from inflammation.\n\n7. Emotional support: seek support from family, friends, or support groups, as dealing with a chronic condition can be emotionally challenging.\n\n8. Sun protection: since sunlight may exacerbate rashes in some dm cases, take precautions like wearing sun-protective clothing, using sunscreen, and avoiding unnecessary sun exposure.\n\n9. Monitor for potential complications: keep track of any changes in symptoms, and report them to your healthcare provider.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and maintaining open communication with your healthcare team, you can manage dermatomyositis' impact on your daily life and maintain a good quality of life.

Complications may include calcium deposits in muscles or skin.\n\nThe cause is unknown. Theories include that it is an autoimmune disease or a result of a viral infection. Dermatomyositis may develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with several forms of malignancy. It is a type of inflammatory myopathy. Diagnosis is typically based on some combination of symptoms, blood tests, electromyography, and muscle biopsies.\n\nWhile no cure for the condition is known, treatments generally improve symptoms. Treatments may include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics and assistive devices, and rest. Medications in the corticosteroids family are typically used with other agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine recommended if steroids are not working well. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also improve outcomes. Most people improve with treatment and in some, the condition resolves completely.\n\nAbout one per 100,000 people per year are newly affected. The condition usually occurs in those in their 40s and 50s with women being affected more often than men. People of any age, however, may be affected. The condition was first described in the 1800s.\n\nSigns and symptoms \nThe main symptoms include several kinds of skin rash along with muscle weakness in both upper arms or thighs.\n\nSkin \nOne form the rashes take is called \"heliotrope\" (a purplish color) or lilac, but may also be red. It can occur around the eyes along with swelling, but also occurs on the upper chest or back what is called the \"shawl\" (around the neck) or \"V-sign\" above the breasts and may also occur on the face, upper arms, thighs, or hands.  Another form the rash takes is called Gottron's sign which are red or violet, sometimes scaly, slightly raised papules that erupt on any of the finger joints (the metacarpophalangeal joints or the interphalangeal joints). Gottron's papules may also be found over other bony prominences including the elbows, knees, or feet. All these rashes are made worse by exposure to sunlight, and are often very itchy, painful, and may bleed.\n\nIf a person exhibits only skin findings characteristic of DM, without weakness or abnormal muscle enzymes, then he or she may be experiencing amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM), formerly known as \"dermatomyositis sine myositis\".\n\nMuscles \nPeople with DM experience progressively worsening muscle weakness in the proximal muscles (for example, the shoulders and thighs). Tasks that use these muscles: standing from sitting, lifting, and climbing stairs, can become increasingly difficult for people with dermatomyositis.\n\nOther \nAround 30% of people have swollen, painful joints, but this is generally mild.\n\nIn some people, the condition affects the lungs, and they may have a cough or difficulty breathing.  If the condition affects the heart,  arrhythmias may occur. If it affects the blood vessels in the stomach or intestines, which is more common in juvenile DM, the people might vomit blood, have black tarry bowel movements, or may develop a hole somewhere in their GI tract.\n\nCauses \n\nThe cause is unknown, but it may result from an initial viral infection or cancer, either of which could raise an autoimmune response.\n\nBetween 7 and 30% of dermatomyositis arise from cancer, probably as an autoimmune response. The most commonly associated cancers are ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer.  18 to 25% of people with amyopathic DM also have cancer. Malignancy in association with dermatomyositis is more prevalent after age 60.\n\nSome cases are inherited, and HLA subtypes HLA-DR3, HLA-DR52, and HLA-DR6 seem to create a disposition to autoimmune dermatomyositis.",

Its development had the purpose of combining cabernet sauvignon's superior quality with carignan's heat resistance to produce an affordable table wine. While it doesn't possess the same distinctive flavor as other types of cabernet wines, it carries their fruitful essence.\n\nIt was developed for california's hot climate, specifically in the san joaquin and napa valleys. As a result, ruby cabernet has improved the quality of bulk wines produced in these areas, thanks to its unique acidity.\n\nSome of the wine regions where ruby cabernet is grown include argentina, australia, brazil, mexico, chile, israel, south africa, and the united states. The grapes have a good color and a pleasant cherry flavor, typically blended into bulk wines. Depending on farming techniques used, it can produce wines with exceptional aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel. The vine is drought resistant and tolerates high winds. \n\n<user> It's interesting to see how different countries cultivate ruby cabernet. can you provide some examples of wineries or vineyards in these regions that are known for producing ruby cabernet wines? and are there any specific recommendations for improving the vineyard conditions to maximize the quality of the grapes and the wine? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! In different regions, some notable examples of wineries and vineyards producing ruby cabernet are as follows:\n\n1. Brazil: vale do são francisco winery in pernambuco (produces botticelli coleção ruby cabernet) and vinícola campos de cima in itaqui, campanha gaúcha (produces a 100% varietal ruby cabernet).\n2. Mexico: valle de guadalupe in baja california (produces cabernet franc - malbec/ruby cabernet); aguascalientes is another region with wines featuring ruby cabernet.\n3. Israel: tishbi winery in zichron ya'akov uses ruby cabernet.\n4. South africa: van loveren \"river red\" blend contains ruby cabernet, grown in the successful robertson district.\n5. United states: ruby cabernet is mainly planted in california's san joaquin valley.\n\nTo maximize the quality of ruby cabernet grapes and wine, vineyards should limit irrigation, thin crop, and expose fruit to the sun, especially in california's san joaquin valley. This approach will enhance the wine's aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel. \n\n<user> What are some of the challenges that ruby cabernet faces in different regions, like south africa, for example? also, could you explain more about the vineyard ground requirements and the vine's characteristics, such as drought resistance and high wind tolerance? \n\n<assistant> One of the challenges ruby cabernet faces in south africa is poor fruit set, which has limited its success in the region. It is also vulnerable to powdery mildew, a fungal disease affecting grapevines.\n\nThe vine of ruby cabernet is notably drought-resistant, meaning it can thrive with limited water supply. This characteristic makes it suitable for regions with hot and dry climates, like california or south africa. Its high wind tolerance allows it to withstand strong gusts, making it adaptable to various vineyard conditions.\n\nFor optimal growth, ruby cabernet vineyards should be situated on vigorous grounds with deep clay loam. The canopy should be open and not completely erected, which ensures better sunlight exposure and air circulation. The spacing beneath the vineyard row is typically around 7-8 feet for vertical shoot positioning, while horizontally divided quadrilateral vineyards require a spacing of about 6-7 feet.\n\nProviding the right conditions for the vine will greatly contribute to the overall quality of the ruby cabernet grapes and the wines they produce. By considering factors like drought resistance, wind tolerance, and proper ground requirements, ruby cabernet can be cultivated to produce enjoyable and affordable table wines. \n\n<user> If i want to try a ruby cabernet wine, which wineries or vineyards would you recommend for a high-quality ruby cabernet varietal or blend, and where can i find them? \n\n<assistant> To experience a high-quality ruby cabernet varietal or blend, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Brazil: vinícola campos de cima in itaqui, campanha gaúcha produces a 100% varietal of the wine ruby cabernet.\n2. Brazil: vale do são francisco winery in pernambuco produces botticelli coleção ruby cabernet.\n3. Australia: andrew mcpherson in victoria uses ruby cabernet in several export wines like full fifteen, which they export to england and denmark.\n4. Mexico: valle de guadalupe in baja california offers cabernet franc - malbec/ruby cabernet.\n5. United states: ruby cabernet wines from california, particularly from the san joaquin valley, can produce standout wines when employing proper farming techniques.\n\nTo find these wines, you can search online retailers that specialize in international wines or visit local wine shops and inquire about availability. If feasible, consider contacting the wineries directly or looking for distributors and retailers carrying their products in your area.\n\nIn addition, attending wine-tasting events or visiting wine bars that offer diverse selections might help you discover high-quality ruby cabernet wines. Keep in mind that personal preferences play a significant role, so exploring various wines from these recommended producers or regions will help you find the one that suits your taste best. ",

Arun grew up in south africa at the phoenix, durban settlement, which his grandfather founded in 1904. He spent two years (1946–48) living with mahatma gandhi at the sevagram ashram in india, which was a transformative experience for him.

He has worked closely with individuals from different faiths, and his philosophies are influenced by buddhist, hindu, muslim, and christian concepts.

Although he has followed in the footsteps of his grandfather as an activist, he has eschewed the ascetic lifestyle of his grandfather.  In 2017 he published The Gift of Anger:  And Other Lessons From My Grandfather Mahatma Gandhi (New York:  Gallery Books/Jeter Publishing 2017).\n\nEarly life\nArun Gandhi grew up in South Africa, with his parents and sister, at the Phoenix, Durban settlement in South Africa, which his grandfather Mohandas Gandhi had established in 1904.  Arun did not meet his grandfather until the age of 12 (though he had seen him once briefly at age 5) when Arun went to live with him for two years (1946–48) at the Sevagram ashram in India. Arun left Sevagram to return to his home in South Africa just weeks before Mohandas Gandhi was assassinated in the garden of the Birla house mansion, now known as Gandhi Smriti, in New Delhi, India, on Friday January 30, 1948.\n\nWhile living at Sevagram, Arun had the advantage of education over the illiterate farm families who worked the surrounding fields. His grandfather urged him to play with the neighboring children after school in order to \"learn what it was like to live in poverty\", as well as to teach those children what he learned in class each day, which Arun Gandhi later described as \"the most creative and enlightening experience for me.\" Eventually, crowds of children and their parents started showing up for lessons with the young Gandhi, which taught him compassion and the need to share.\n\nCareer\nArun Manilal Gandhi considers himself to be a Hindu but expresses universalist views. Gandhi has worked closely with Christian priests and his philosophies are strongly influenced by Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian concepts. Like his grandfather, he also believes in the concept of 'non-violence' (Ahimsa). Gandhi claims to be more Unitarian then anything else. He took his prayers public and does not practice Hinduism in the traditional sense.\n\nIn 1982, when Columbia Pictures released the feature film, Gandhi, based on his grandfather's life, Gandhi wrote an article criticizing the Indian government for subsidizing the film with $25 million, arguing that there were more important things to spend such money on. Though his article was widely reprinted and celebrated, after attending a special screening of the film, Gandhi concluded that it accurately conveyed his grandfather's philosophy and legacy (despite its historical inaccuracies), and was so moved by it that he wrote another article retracting the first one.\n\nIn 1987, Arun Gandhi moved to the United States along with his wife, Sunanda, to work on a study at the University of Mississippi. This study examined and contrasted the sorts of prejudices that existed in India, the U.S., and South Africa. Afterward they moved to Memphis, Tennessee and founded the M. K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence hosted by the Christian Brothers University, a Catholic academic institution. This institute was dedicated to applying the principles of nonviolence at both local and global scales. As co-founders of the institute, both husband and wife received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award \"for bringing the legacy of Gandhi to America\" which was awarded at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston.  In 1996, he cofounded the Season for Nonviolence as a yearly celebration of the philosophies and lives of Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nIn 2003 Gandhi was one of the signatories to Humanism and Its Aspirations (Humanist Manifesto III).\n\nIn late 2007, Gandhi co-taught a course entitled \"Gandhi on Personal Leadership and Nonviolence\" at Salisbury University in Salisbury, Maryland. On November 12, 2007, Gandhi gave a lecture for the Salisbury University Center for Conflict Resolution’s “One Person Can Make a Difference” Lecture Series, entitled “Nonviolence in the Age of Terrorism”.",

Lee high school in tyler, texas. As a senior, he was named all-district and all-east texas, and was one of three players on the all-state team. He had the opportunity to attend universities like texas a&m, tcu, smu, and arkansas, but ultimately decided on oklahoma state university.\n\nWhile at oklahoma state, pettigrew majored in economics and became a standout tight end for the team. Throughout his college career, he recorded 112 receptions for 1,450 yards and nine touchdowns. Some notable achievements include an all-big 12 honorable mention in 2006, being named first-team all-big 12 football at tight end in 2007, and playing in all 13 games in 2007 and 2008 seasons.\n\nPettigrew was selected in the first round (20th overall) of the 2009 nfl draft by the detroit lions. During his rookie season, he caught six passes for 72 yards, including a game-winning touchdown against the cleveland browns. However, later in the 2009 season, he suffered a knee injury and was placed on injured reserve.\n\nOver the years, pettigrew became an impactful player for the lions, setting franchise records as a tight end. He recorded 83 receptions in the 2011 season and 777 yards, the most yards by a lions tight end in a single season. After signing a four-year deal with the lions in 2014, pettigrew's career was plagued with injuries. In december 2015, he suffered a torn acl and began the 2016 season on the pup list. Eventually, on december 9, 2016, he was released by the lions, concluding his time in the nfl. \n\n<user> What kind of difficulties did he face after his professional football career ended, and how did he cope with them? also, can you give me more information about the incidents in dallas and pittsburgh? \n\n<assistant> After his nfl career ended, brandon pettigrew faced some legal troubles. On february 5, 2017, he was arrested for disorderly conduct and public drunkenness following a bar fight in dallas, texas. Then, on july 9, 2018, pettigrew was arrested in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, after an altercation involving unpaid limo fees. In that incident, he was accused of aggravated assault, but the charges were later withdrawn in november 2018, including the diversion of services charge.\n\nIt is not clear how pettigrew coped with these legal issues, but the fact that the charges were withdrawn might suggest that he was able to address the situation and move on. It's important to note that transitioning from a long and successful football career to a life outside the sport can be challenging for many players. \n\n<user> Do you have any information about his life post-football? what is he doing now, and has he found any success or fulfillment in a new career or any other areas of his life? \n\n<assistant> Unfortunately, there is limited information available about brandon pettigrew's current personal or professional pursuits after retiring from the nfl. It's not uncommon for former athletes to maintain a low profile after their careers, especially when they encounter legal challenges as pettigrew had experienced.\n\nMany former nfl players have pursued various career paths, such as entrepreneurship, coaching, broadcasting, or even philanthropy. Some also continue their education in their area of interest, leveraging the skills and experiences gained during their playing career. Additionally, numerous nfl alumni find success and fulfillment outside the football world, and it's possible that brandon pettigrew has also found a rewarding path.\n\nWhile we don't have specific information about what pettigrew is doing, it is important to remember that transitioning from a professional athletic career to a new life can be a complicated and challenging process that requires time, support, and adjustment. Pettigrew's focus might have been on rehabilitating from injuries and dealing with his legal issues while exploring new opportunities. \n\n<user> Is there any chance of him making a return to football in any capacity, like coaching or scouting? \n\n<assistant> While there is no recent information or public announcements about brandon pettigrew returning to football in some capacity, it is always a possibility. Many retired athletes choose to remain associated with the sport by taking up coaching, scouting, or even front-office positions. They bring invaluable experience and a deep understanding of the game, which can benefit teams and younger players.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge that the decision to return to football in any capacity depends on pettigrew's personal interests and desire to be involved in the sport. Additionally, his recent history involving legal issues might play a role in determining the nature of his association with the football world.\n\nIn conclusion, while we can't rule out the possibility of pettigrew returning to football in a non-playing capacity, there is no known information or statements suggesting his intentions at this time.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I recently learned about southern africa and its unique geography. countries included in this region and its natural resources? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Southern africa refers to the southernmost subregion of the african continent and is home to several countries. In political geography, southern africa generally includes angola, botswana, comoros, eswatini, lesotho, madagascar, malawi, mauritius, mayotte, mozambique, namibia, réunion, saint helena, ascension and tristan da cunha, the scattered islands in the indian ocean, south africa, zambia, and zimbabwe. However, the united nations geoscheme has slightly different classifications, which can lead to variations in lists of countries belonging to southern africa.\n\nThe physical location of southern africa is south of the congo river basin, and the region has a number of significant river systems. The zambezi river is the most prominent, flowing from northwest zambia and western angola to the indian ocean, passing over the magnificent victoria falls on the border between zambia and zimbabwe. This waterfall is one of the largest in the world and attracts many tourists.\n\nSouthern africa has diverse terrain, ranging from forests and grasslands to deserts and mountains. The area is known for its vast mineral resources, such as platinum, the platinum group elements, chromium, vanadium, cobalt, uranium, gold, copper, titanium, iron, manganese, silver, beryllium, and diamonds. These resources set southern africa apart from other sub-saharan african regions. \n\n<user> That's quite intriguing! i'm also curious about the different climates in southern africa. climates and how the tropic of capricorn factors into it? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Southern africa experiences a mix of subtropical and temperate climates. The tropic of capricorn, an imaginary line of latitude at approximately 23.5° south, runs right through the middle of the region. This line divides southern africa into its subtropical and temperate halves.\n\nIn the subtropical half, which is north of the tropic of capricorn, you will generally find warmer and more humid climates. The vegetation in this area is typically lush, and the terrain can include dense forests, grasslands, and swamps.\n\nOn the other hand, the temperate half, which is south of the tropic of capricorn, has milder temperatures and a more mediterranean-like climate, with warm summers and cool, wet winters. The vegetation in this part of southern africa is often characterized by fynbos, a unique type of heathland found mostly in the coastal regions. Other areas in the temperate half may have arid savannas, semi-deserts, and deserts.\n\nThe climate's variation in southern africa contributes to the region’s biodiversity, providing a wide range of habitats for plant and animal life. Different species have adapted to the specific conditions of their environments, leading to unique ecosystems throughout the region. \n\n<user> That's fascinating! can you explain more about the southern african development community and its purpose? \n\n<assistant> The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a regional organization established in 1980 to foster collaboration and cooperation among its member countries. The main objectives of SADC are to promote socio-economic development, political stability, and regional integration in Southern Africa. SADC works to enhance living standards and create sustainable economic opportunities for the people in the region.\n\nThe current members of the SADC include Angola, Botswana, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. These countries work together on various projects and initiatives that aim to improve infrastructure, trade, food security, energy, health, education, and other key sectors.\n\nSADC also collaborates on regional policy coordination and harmonization, aiming to create a more integrated and prosperous Southern African region. By working together, the member countries can take advantage of their collective resources, knowledge, and experiences to address common challenges and achieve shared goals. \n\n<user> Animals living in southern africa, for a kid to understand? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Southern africa is home to many amazing animals because of its different climates and landscapes. In the grasslands and savannas, you can find zebras, elephants, and giraffes, which are really tall and have long necks to reach for leaves on trees. There are also lions, leopards, and cheetahs – these big cats are strong and fast!\n\nIn the forests, there are monkeys and lovely birds with bright colors, like the african fish eagle and the lilac-breasted roller. In the deserts, animals like meerkats, ostriches, and special beetles called fogstand beetles live. They have learned to find water and food even in very dry places.\n\nSouthern africa also has many national parks and reserves to protect these fantastic animals and their habitats. Going on a safari in these parks is a great way to see and learn about all the wonderful creatures that live in southern africa. ",

The physical location is the large part of Africa to the south of the extensive Congo River basin. Southern Africa is home to a number of river systems; the Zambezi River is the most prominent. The Zambezi flows from the northwest corner of Zambia and western Angola  to the Indian Ocean on the coast of Mozambique. Along the way, the Zambezi River flows over the mighty Victoria Falls on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Victoria Falls is one of the largest waterfalls in the world and a major tourist attraction for the region.\n\nSouthern Africa includes both subtropical and temperate climates, with the Tropic of Capricorn running through the middle of the region, dividing it into its subtropical and temperate halves. Countries commonly included in Southern Africa include Angola, Botswana, the Comoros, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In cultural geography, the island country of Madagascar is often not included due to its distinct language and cultural heritage.\n\nDefinitions and usage\nIn political geography, the term Southern Africa generally includes Angola, Botswana, the Comoros, Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte (France), Mozambique, Namibia, Réunion (France), Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (United Kingdom), the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean (France), South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. However, the United Nations geoscheme for Africa includes the Comoros, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte, Mozambique, Réunion, the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean (as a part of the French Southern Territories), Zambia, and Zimbabwe in Eastern Africa, Angola in Middle Africa (aka Central Africa), and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (under the name Saint Helena) in Western Africa instead. Some atlases include Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe in Central Africa instead of Southern or Eastern Africa.\n\nOccasionally, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Seychelles, and Tanzania have also been included in Southern Africa.\n\nIn physical geography, the geographical delineation for the subregion is the portion of Africa south of the Cunene and Zambezi rivers: Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and the part of Mozambique which lies south of the Zambezi River. That definition is most often used in South Africa for natural sciences and particularly in guide books such as Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa, the Southern African Bird Atlas Project and Mammals of the Southern African Subregion. It is not used in political, economic or human geography contexts because the definition cuts Mozambique in two.\n\nUN scheme of geographic regions and the SACU \nIn the United Nations scheme of geographic regions, five states constitute Southern Africa:\n\n \n  (Swaziland)\n \n \n \n\nThe Southern African Customs Union (SACU), created in 1969, also comprises the five states in the UN subregion of Southern Africa.\n\nSADC membership\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) was established in 1980 to facilitate co-operation in the region.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you describe the morphology and staining characteristics of mycobacterium bovis bacteria? \n\n<assistant> Mycobacterium bovis (M. Bovis) is a bacterium that causes tuberculosis in cattle. It has a slow-growing aerobic nature, with a 16- to 20-hour generation time. Morphologically, M. Bovis bacteria appear as curved or straight rods and can sometimes form filaments that break into bacilli or cocci when disturbed. They do not have flagella, fimbria, or a capsule. The size of bacteria from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis group is typically 1.0-4.0µm long by 0.2-0.3µm wide in tissues. In culture, they may appear as cocci or bacilli up to 6-8µm long.\n\nM. Bovis is a Gram-positive, acid-fast bacterium. The cell wall is composed of up to 60% lipid, which contributes to its hydrophobic characteristics, slow growth, and resistance to various environmental factors. Staining with analine dyes is difficult for M. Bovis, but its acid-fast nature can be confirmed using the Ziehl-Neelsen staining method. The bacteria stain pink with hot carbol fuschin and resist decolorization with 3% hydrochloric acid in 95% alcohol. Following washing, the slide is counterstained with methylene blue or another suitable dye. These bacteria are non-spore-forming. \n\n<user> What are the growth requirements and appearance of colonies for m. bovis in culture? additionally, how is m.bovis distinct in structure and metabolism compared to m.tberea? \n\n<assistant> M. Bovis is a facultative intracellular parasite. For in vitro growth, it requires special culture media. An example is dorset's egg medium, which contains ingredients such as egg yolk, phosphate buffer, magnesium salts, and sodium pyruvate. Amino acids may be added, but glycerol is not included as it is inhibitory. The growth of m. Bovis usually takes several weeks at 37°c to reach colonies visible to the naked eye. It is strictly aerobic and doesn't grow at 25°c, with optimal growth occurring at 37-38°c. M. Bovis doesn't reduce nitrate or niacin and is resistant to pyrazinamide while being sensitive to thiophene-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide.\n\nThe appearance of colonies after 3-4 weeks of growth starts as minute, dull flakes which then thicken to form dry, irregular masses standing above the culture medium surface. Eventually, this grows over the entire medium surface, forming a rough, waxy blanket that becomes thick and wrinkled. Colonies are initially yellow and darken to deep yellow or brick red when exposed to light. In liquid media, growth only occurs on the surface, unless a wetting agent like tween 80 is added.\n\nM. Bovis has a similar structure and metabolism to m. Tuberculosis; however, there are differences. M. Bovis lacks pyruvate kinase activity due to a point mutation in pyka that affects binding of the mg2+ cofactor. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the last step of glycolysis, so when m. Bovis is unable to enter oxidative metabolism, it must rely on alternative carbon sources like amino acids or fatty acids for energy metabolism. \n\n<user> How was m. bovis historically significant in terms of animal farming? and in what ways is it transmitted and controlled nowadays? \n\n<assistant> Historically, during the first half of the 20th century, m. Bovis was a significant concern in animal farming, being responsible for more losses among farm animals than all other infectious diseases combined. M. Bovis infection typically occurred upon ingestion or inhalation of the bacterium.\n\nNowadays, m. Bovis transmission to humans is primarily through consuming raw milk from infected cows or via aerosol droplets. Infections in developed countries are rare due to pasteurization, which kills the bacteria in infected milk. In the uk, for example, cattle are tested for m. Bovis as part of an eradication program, and those that test positive are culled. The carcasses are inspected and certified as fit for human consumption before they enter the food chain. However, in developing countries where pasteurization is not commonplace, m. Bovis remains a relatively common cause of human tuberculosis. \n\n<user> Even with pasteurization and other precautions, how can m. bovis still potentially pose a threat to human health in developed countries and what measures can be taken to further mitigate the risk? \n\n<assistant> Although pasteurization and eradication programs have significantly reduced the risk of m. Bovis infection in developed countries, there is still a possibility of transmission. The potential risks can come from consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, contact with infected animals, or exposure to environments contaminated with the bacterium. Additionally, international travel can increase the chance of exposure to infected animals or products from regions where m. Bovis is more prevalent.\n\nTo further mitigate the risk of m. Bovis infection in developed countries, the following measures can be considered:\n\n1. Public education and awareness about the risks associated with consuming raw or unpasteurized dairy products.\n2. Strengthening surveillance and testing programs for livestock, ensuring timely identification and culling of infected animals.\n3. Implementing biosecurity measures, proper disposal of animal waste, and hygiene protocols at farms to minimize the spread of the bacterium.\n4.

        "reference": "Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) is a slow-growing (16- to 20-hour generation time) aerobic bacterium and the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle (known as bovine TB). It is related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium which causes tuberculosis in humans. M. bovis can jump the species barrier and cause tuberculosis-like infection in humans and other mammals.\n\nBacterium morphology and staining \n\nThe bacteria are curved or straight rods. They sometimes form filaments, which fragment into bacilli or cocci once disturbed. In tissues they form slender rods, straight or curved, or club-shaped.\nShort, relatively plump bacilli (rods) in tissue smears, large slender beaded rods in culture. They have no flagella or fimbria, and no capsule.\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis group bacteria are 1.0-4.0µm long by 0.2-0.3 µm wide in tissues. In culture, they may appear as cocci, or as bacilli up to 6-8 µm long.\n\nThe bacteria stain Gram-positive, acid-fast. The cell wall contains as high as 60% lipid, giving the mycobacteria their hydrophobic characteristics, slow growth, and resistance to desiccation, disinfectants, acids and antibodies. (Mycobacterium family). They are not easy to stain with analine dyes; although they are Gram positive, confirming this may be difficult. Ziehl–Neelsen staining results in stain pink with hot carbol fuscin and then resist decolourisation with 3% hydrochloric acid in 95% alcohol (i.e. they are acid-alcohol fast); following washing, the slide is counterstained with e.g. methylene blue.\n\nThey are nonspore-forming.\n\nCulture and biochemical features\n\nGrowth requirements\nM. bovis is a facultative intracellular parasite. For in vitro growth, special culture media are required; for example, Dorset's egg medium incorporates egg yolk, phosphate buffer, magnesium salts, and sodium pyruvate; amino acids may be added, but glycerol is not included, as it is inhibitory. It is inhibited by glycerine. Culture generally requires several weeks at 37°C to reach colonies visible to the unaided human eye. It is strictly aerobic, and grows at 37, but not at 25°C. Optimal growth occurs at 37-38°C. The species does not reduce nitrate or niacin, and is resistant to pyrazinamide. It is sensitive to thiophene-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide.\n\nAppearance of colonies\nInitially (after 3–4 weeks), its minute, dull flakes, begin to thicken to form dry, irregular masses standing high above the culture medium surface. Eventually, confluent growth is seen over the whole culture surface, forming a rough, waxy blanket, becoming thick and wrinkled and reaching up the sides of the container. Colonies are yellow when first visible, darkening to deep yellow and eventually brick red, if exposed to light. In fluid media, growth is on the surface only, unless a wetting agent (e.g. Tween 80) is added to the medium.\n\nCell structure and metabolism \nM. bovis is similar in structure and metabolism to M. tuberculosis. M. bovis is a Gram-positive, acid-fast, rod-shaped, aerobic bacterium. Unlike M. tuberculosis, M. bovis lacks pyruvate kinase activity, due to pykA containing a point mutation that affects binding of Mg2+ cofactor. Pyruvate kinase catalyses the final step of glycolysis, the dephosphorylation of phosphorenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Therefore, in M. bovis, glycolytic intermediates are unable to enter into oxidative metabolism. Although no specific studies have been performed,  M. bovis seemingly must rely on amino acids or fatty acids as an alternative carbon source for energy metabolism.\n\nPathogenesis\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, M. bovis is estimated to have been responsible for more losses among farm animals than all other infectious diseases combined. Infection occurs if the bacterium is ingested or inhaled.\n\nM. bovis is usually transmitted to humans by consuming raw milk from infected cows, although it can also spread via aerosol droplets. Actual infections in humans are nowadays rare in developed countries, mainly because pasteurisation kills M. bovis bacteria in infected milk. In the UK, cattle are tested for the disease as part of an eradication program and culled if they test positive. Such cattle can still enter the human food chain, but only after a meat inspector or a government veterinary surgeon has inspected the carcass and certified that it is fit for human consumption.  However, in areas of the developing world where pasteurisation is not routine, M. bovis is a relatively common cause of human tuberculosis.",

It was established in 1891 as part of the british museum library, which later became the british library, starting with the collection of thomas tapling.\n\nThe first significant philatelic donation came in 1890 when hubert haes donated two albums of postage stamps collected by him and walter van noorden. It was given with the condition that the british museum library would create a philatelic collection. The following year, the collections were officially formed with the bequest of the tapling collection, which was highly valuable, and has since grown through bequests, donations, and deposits by the crown agency.\n\nThe british library philatelic collections includes various artefacts related to postal history, such as postage stamps, postal stationery, essays, proofs, covers, and more. Philately is interpreted in its broadest sense, and the collection also features unique items like original unused artwork and horse licenses.\n\nOver time, the collections have greatly expanded with the acquisition of the crawford library in 1913, african stamps from mrs. A cunningham in 1944, railway letter stamps from mrs. Clement williams in 1949, and an extensive airmail collection donated by mrs. Augustine fitzgerald in 1951. The department of printed books managed the collections until they were handed over to the british library in 1973. The british library has since grown into one of the world's leading philatelic research centers. \n\n<user> What are some notable items in the collections? \n\n<assistant> The British Library Philatelic Collections contain numerous notable items, reflecting its comprehensive and diverse nature. Some of the exceptional pieces include:\n\n1. A unique proof sheet of 26 Revenue 1765 Newspaper and Pamphlet one penny impressions with registration certificate: These were issued as a result of the Stamp Act of 1765, which sought to raise taxes to fund the defense of the American Colonies against the French. The tax applied to legal documents, licenses, newspapers, pamphlets, and almanacs in the American Colonies and various other territories.\n\n2. The Tapling Collection: This remarkable collection was donated by Thomas Tapling and includes many outstanding items, such as the famous British Guiana 1 cent magenta stamp, the rare Swedish Treskilling Yellow, and the first adhesive postage stamp, the Penny Black. The Tapling Collection is one of the most valuable components of the British Library Philatelic Collections.\n\n3. The Crawford Library: Donated by the Earl of Crawford in his Will, the Crawford Library includes about 4,500 works and is the foundation of the British Library's philatelic literature collection. It was the foremost collection of philatelic books in the world at the time it was acquired.\n\n4. Captain John Alcock's pilot's license: Captain Alcock was a British aviator who, along with Lieutenant Arthur Whitten Brown, completed the first non-stop transatlantic flight in 1919.\n\n5.

These territories included the region of the duchy of magdeburg, the brunswick-lüneburg territories of hanover and brunswick-wolfenbüttel, and the electorate of hesse. The kingdom's capital was cassel (modern spelling kassel). It was a member of the confederation of the rhine and was considered a napoleonic \"model state.\"\n\nDespite its short existence, the progressive reforms enacted in the kingdom of westphalia did have a lasting impact. The kingdom's modern-style constitution and the various freedoms introduced, such as equal rights for jews and liberated serfs, served as a model for reform in other german states. Even though most of its territories eventually became prussian in 1815, many of the reforms introduced in westphalia remained in place. \n\n<user> It's interesting to see the progressive nature of this short-lived kingdom. how did the financial situation of the kingdom of westphalia become so bad? and what role did napoleon play in the kingdom's economy during its existence? lastly, how were these financial issues connected to the eventual downfall of the kingdom? \n\n<assistant> The kingdom of westphalia experienced financial difficulties largely due to heavy taxes and payments demanded by napoleon. The first french empire saw the kingdom as a source of revenue and conscripted soldiers to supplement its own armed forces. Many of these conscripts never returned from the campaigns, such as the invasion of russia in 1812.\n\nThe kingdom's economy was already relatively poor, and these financial obligations further strained its resources. By 1812, the kingdom of westphalia was essentially bankrupt. As napoleon's power waned and he retreated in the face of advancing allied forces in 1813, the ill-fated kingdom was overrun by the allies. In 1815, most of the kingdom's territories were absorbed by prussia. The financial collapse of the kingdom played a significant role alongside the weakening of napoleon's influence in the eventual downfall of the kingdom of westphalia. \n\n<user> Could you provide specific examples of how the modern reforms enacted by the kingdom of westphalia impacted other german states and influenced their development? \n\n<assistant> Certainly, the progressive reforms enacted by the kingdom of westphalia significantly influenced other german states in their development. One notable example is the shift toward granting equal rights to jews. The kingdom enacted germany's first laws granting jews equal rights in 1808, and this laid the groundwork for the expansion of similar rights and emancipation in other german states, such as prussia, bavaria, and baden.\n\nAnother key reform was the liberation of serfs and the introduction of equal rights for all citizens. This also resonated with other german states, leading to the abolition of serfdom and the establishment of the concept of citizenship. The move to grant everyone the right to a jury trial exemplifies the progress toward equal rights under the law in westphalia, which later spread to other states.\n\nThe enactment of the kingdom's modern-style constitution also impacted the political landscape. As the first monarchy in germany to introduce such a constitution, the kingdom of westphalia influenced other states to consider administrative and constitutional reforms. Although the kingdom itself did not survive, the ideas generated during its existence persisted and contributed to the subsequent evolution of governance and the growth of the german federation.\n\nThe kingdom of westphalia, as a napoleonic model state, showcased the potential for progressive legal and social change.

        "reference": "The Kingdom of Westphalia was a kingdom in Germany, with a population of 2.6 million, that existed from 1807 to 1813. It included territory in Hesse and other parts of present-day Germany. While formally independent, it was a vassal state of the First French Empire and was ruled by Napoleon's brother Jérôme Bonaparte. It was named after Westphalia, but this was a misnomer since the kingdom had little territory in common with that area; rather the kingdom mostly covered territory formerly known as Eastphalia.\n\nNapoleon imposed the first written modern constitution in Germany, a French-style central administration, and agricultural reform. The Kingdom liberated the serfs and gave everyone equal rights and the right to a jury trial. In 1808 the Kingdom passed Germany's first laws granting Jews equal rights, thereby providing a model for reform in the other German states. Westphalia seemed to be progressive in immediately enacting and enforcing the new reforms.\n\nThe country was relatively poor but Napoleon demanded heavy taxes and payments and conscripted soldiers. Few of the men who marched into Russia with Napoleon in 1812 ever returned. The Kingdom was bankrupt by 1812. When Napoleon was retreating in the face of Allied advances in 1813, the Kingdom was overrun by the Allies and (in 1815) most of its territories became Prussian. Most of the reforms, however, remained in place.\n\nFormation\n\nThe Kingdom of Westphalia was created in 1807 by merging territories ceded by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Peace of Tilsit, among them the region of the Duchy of Magdeburg west of the Elbe River, the Brunswick-Lüneburg territories of Hanover and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and the Electorate of Hesse. Hesse's capital Cassel (modern spelling Kassel) then fulfilled the same function for Westphalia, and the king kept the court at the palace of Wilhelmshöhe, renamed Napoleonshöhe. The state was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine.\n\nSince it was intended as a Napoleonic \"model state\", a constitution was written and enacted by King Jérôme on 7 December 1807, the day after he had arrived in Cassel, making Westphalia the first monarchy in Germany with a modern-style constitution.",

These tasks aim to support the australian defence force in times of need, ensuring security and promoting peace.\n\nThe sasr is structured primarily for covert long-range reconnaissance and surveillance missions, operating in small teams within enemy-controlled territory. By contrast, commando units conduct raids in larger groups. Moreover, the regiment is responsible for maintaining a specialist counter-terrorist capability. Other capabilities include training local or indigenous forces, recovering australian citizens, and providing humanitarian assistance. The sasr is also trained in counter-insurgency operations.\n\nIn the warfighting and special reconnaissance role, the sasr typically operates in small patrols of five to six operators. Their main tasks involve infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing intelligence on enemy activities and capabilities while evading rather than confronting the enemy. Sasr soldiers are also responsible for directing fire support, such as air strikes, to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces.\n\nThe regiment also plays a crucial role in counter-terrorism and special recovery operations. For instance, a part of the sasr forms australia's domestic tactical assault group (west) that is maintained at high readiness for handling military operations beyond the scope of state and federal police tactical groups. The unit deals with offensive counter-terrorist operations, hostage recovery, and boarding operations on moving ships and offshore oil platforms.\n\nTo sum up, the main roles and responsibilities of the special air service regiment (sasr) include long-range reconnaissance, special recovery operations, counter-terrorism, and specialized training. They are skilled in diverse areas to ensure the successful completion of their missions and to support the australian defence force as needed. \n\n<user> What kind of training do they go through? \n\n<assistant> The training for the special air service regiment (sasr) is both demanding and rigorous as they are expected to operate in various challenging environments and situations. Candidates must undergo a multi-stage selection process, followed by specialized training, to develop the skills and mindset required for the regiment. The entire process can last around 18 to 24 months.\n\nThe initial selection process usually involves several weeks of intense physical and mental testing, designed to assess a candidate’s endurance, teamwork, determination, adaptability, and mental strength. This phase includes grueling tasks, such as timed marches carrying heavy loads, navigational exercises, and sleep deprivation.\n\nCandidates who successfully pass the selection phase then proceed to the reinforcement cycle, where they receive further training in various specialist courses. These courses may include aspects such as patrolling and reconnaissance techniques, air operations (e.g., freefall parachuting and helicopter insertion), survival and evasion skills, language training, combat medicine, demolitions, sniping, and advanced driving techniques.\n\nMoreover, the sasr personnel also undergo training in weaponry and tactics that reflect the current and anticipated operational environment. They are taught how to operate across several different terrains, like jungle, desert, and mountainous areas. The focus is on mastering skills such as precision shooting, hand-to-hand combat, and infiltration and extraction techniques, along with various other specializations.\n\nIn short, the training for the sasr is designed to push the candidates to their limits, preparing them to face the most demanding of situations and accomplish their missions with professionalism and resolve. \n\n<user> What types of missions and operations has the sasr been involved in? \n\n<assistant> The special air service regiment (sasr) has a long history of participating in various missions and operations, both domestically and internationally, ranging from peacekeeping to conventional warfare.\n\nSome of the key operations and missions the sasr has been involved in include:\n\n1. Borneo during the indonesia-malaysia confrontation: from 1965 to 1966, the sasr conducted clandestine reconnaissance and patrol missions along the indonesian borneo border to gather intelligence on indonesian forces and deter them from crossing into malaysian territories.\n\n2. The vietnam war: the sasr operated in vietnam from 1966 to 1971, primarily engaging in long-range reconnaissance and direct-action missions. They were responsible for covering large areas of the countryside, gathering intelligence, and conducting ambushes or raids against enemy forces.\n\n3. Somalia: in 1993, the sasr was deployed as part of the australian contribution to the united nations operation in somalia (unosom ii), providing aid and security to humanitarian relief efforts in the conflict-ridden country.\n\n4. Kuwait: during the gulf war, the sasr played a role in operation desert storm, undertaking missions such as reconnaissance and sabotage behind iraqi lines.\n\n5. East timor: in 1999, the sasr was involved in the international force for east timor (interfet), assisting in peacekeeping efforts and ensuring a smooth transition to an independent east timor.\n\n6. Iraq and afghanistan: since the beginning of the 21st century, the sasr has participated in various operations in iraq and afghanistan, undertaking reconnaissance, direct action, and counter-insurgency missions.\n\nApart from these operations, the sasr also provides a counter-terrorist capability and has been involved in numerous domestic security operations to safeguard australian interests.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> History of piccadilly street in london? \n\n<assistant> Piccadilly is a historic street in London, which has been a main road since at least medieval times. During the Middle Ages, it was known as \"the road to Reading\" or \"the way from Colnbrook.\" Its importance grew during the Tudor period when property development and speculation became a lucrative business, as expansion beyond London's city walls became safer.\n\nThe plot of land on which Piccadilly now stands was granted to William Dodington by Elizabeth I in 1559-60, and later it was owned by a brewer named Thomas Wilson. A small parcel of land, which may have never belonged to the Crown, was owned by Anthony Cotton during the reign of Henry VIII. His descendant, John Cotton, granted it to John Golightly in 1547. This plot was eventually sold to a tailor named Robert Baker around 1611-12.\n\nBaker became financially successful by making and selling a type of collar called piccadills. After purchasing the land, he enclosed it and built several dwellings, including a residence and shop for himself. This marked the beginning of the street's development. Over time, Piccadilly saw the construction of notable stately homes like Clarendon House, Burlington House, and Devonshire House.\n\nIn the 18th century, the street became the location for booksellers and famous coaching inns like the Old White Horse Cellar. In the following century, the Ritz Hotel was built on the site of the Bath Hotel and Walsingham House. Piccadilly became infamous in the 1960s as the center of London's illegal drug trade.\n\nToday, Piccadilly is considered one of London's principal shopping streets, with landmarks such as the Ritz, Park Lane, Athenaeum and Intercontinental hotels, Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy, the RAF Club, Hatchards, the Embassy of Japan, and the High Commission of Malta. The street has also inspired works of fiction by authors like Oscar Wilde and P.G. Wodehouse and is included on the London Monopoly board. \n\n<user> What is the significance of burlington house and the societies housed there? \n\n<assistant> Burlington house is a historically significant building located on the northern side of piccadilly. It was built in 1664 and has since played an important role in various aspects of british society. Throughout its long history, the building has been home to several notable societies, each of which has contributed significantly to their respective fields.\n\nThe royal academy of arts is one such prestigious institution housed within burlington house. Established in 1768, it is an independent, privately funded institution that promotes the creation, enjoyment, and appreciation of visual arts through exhibitions, education, and debate. As one of the foremost art institutions in the united kingdom, its mission is to serve as a voice for art and artists.\n\nThe geological society of london, founded in 1807, is also based at burlington house. It is the oldest national geological society in the world and is dedicated to the promotion of earth sciences for the benefit of the public. The society holds regular meetings, publishes scientific literature, and hosts various educational activities.\n\nThe royal astronomical society, formed in 1820, is another organization housed in burlington house. This learned society focuses on astronomy and geophysics, and its membership comprises scientists and enthusiasts from around the world. The society organizes scientific meetings, publishes research, awards grants for scientific projects, and engages in a wide range of outreach activities to promote public understanding of astronomy and geophysics.\n\nThese notable societies, along with others based at burlington house, contribute to the building's significance and its crucial role in fostering intellectual and scientific progress. Burlington house serves not only as a shared physical space for these institutions but also as a symbol of cooperation, shared knowledge, and advancement in various academic disciplines.\n\nBy providing a home for these societies, burlington house has played an essential role in the promotion of art, science, and education throughout its history. Its presence on piccadilly highlights the street's importance in london's cultural and intellectual landscape, making it a key destination for anyone interested in the rich history of the city and the disciplines it has helped nurture and develop. \n\n<user> Can you tell me more about Piccadilly Circus station and its unique design? \n\n<assistant> Piccadilly circus station is a unique and historically significant underground station located at the eastern end of piccadilly street in london. Designed by renowned british architect charles holden, the station was built between 1925 and 1928. It stands out due to its architectural style and the fact that it was the first underground station in london to have no above-ground premises.\n\nHolden's design for the station features a modern and minimalist aesthetic, with a focus on functional elements and clean lines. The absence of above-ground buildings means that the station is only accessible through subways from street level. This innovative approach gives the station a distinctive look and feel, setting it apart from other underground stations in the city.\n\nThe use of subways for access was a groundbreaking concept at the time and marked a shift in the design of underground stations. Eliminating above-ground buildings allowed for a more efficient use of urban space while simultaneously reducing the visual impact of the station on the surrounding area.\n\nIn addition to its unique design features, piccadilly circus station is also historically significant due to its role in the development of london's transportation infrastructure. Opened in 1906 as part of the bakerloo line, the station was later expanded to accommodate the increasing number of passengers when the piccadilly line was extended in 1928.\n\nToday, piccadilly circus station remains a major transportation hub and an important part of london's underground network. It serves both the bakerloo and piccadilly lines and provides convenient access to numerous attractions, shops, and theaters nearby. The station's innovative design and its role in shaping london's transportation history make it an interesting and noteworthy landmark on piccadilly street. ",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Lw6/8 classification in para-skiing? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Lw6/8 is a classification in both para-alpine and para-nordic skiing for athletes with upper extremity issues. It is designed for skiers who have paralysis or motor paresis affecting one arm, a single upper arm amputation, or cp8 classified cerebral palsy. The international paralympic committee (ipc) defines this classification for individuals with a disability in one upper limb, skiing with two normal skis and one pole. The disability should be such that the functional use of more than one pole is not feasible.\n\nThe classification can be further divided into lw6 and lw8. Lw6 refers to skiers with above-the-elbow amputations or paralysis affecting the whole arm. On the other hand, lw8 is for skiers with below-the-elbow amputations or lacking functional use below the elbow.\n\nClassification for international para-alpine events is done through ipc alpine skiing for para-nordic events, and it is managed by the ipc nordic skiing technical committee. For regional competitions, classification is taken care of by the respective national federations.\n\nLw6/8 skiers use two skis and one pole in both para-alpine and para-nordic skiing events. Techniques and equipment are adapted to help them manage the challenges caused by their disability, such as lateral balance and protective measures to prevent frostbite on the remaining limb. In the biathlon, athletes can use a rifle support while shooting.\n\nDifferent classifications may compete against each other in competitions using a factoring system, which levels the playing field by adjusting athletes' finish times based on their functional mobility or vision levels. \n\n<user> How do they protect the stump of the arm? \n\n<assistant> Protecting the stump of the amputated arm is crucial for lw6/8 skiers to avoid injuries or frostbite during their skiing activities. One way they protect the stump is by using different types of padding materials, such as socks, to provide cushioning and insulation. This helps to minimize exposure to cold, as well as protect the stump from potential impact and accidental bumps while skiing.\n\nAnother common method is to use a mitten or cork specifically designed to cover and protect the stump, helping to reduce external pressure and impacts during skiing. These prosthetic or adaptive devices can be customized for a comfortable and secure fit on the residual limb.\n\nIt is crucial to maintain proper care, protection, and hygiene of the residual limb or stump to prevent skin issues, infections, or complications. This involves regular cleaning, checking for signs of redness or irritation, and monitoring any changes in sensation or pain in the stump area. Timely communication with healthcare professionals or prosthetists can further ensure athletes maintain their optimal health, well-being, and performance in para-skiing. \n\n<user> How do lw6/8 skiers compensate for balance issues while skiing? \n\n<assistant> Lw6/8 skiers often face challenges related to lateral balance during their skiing activities due to the disability or amputation in one upper limb. To compensate for these balance issues, adaptive skiing techniques have been developed to help these athletes maintain control and stability on the slopes.\n\nOne of the key techniques used by lw6/8 skiers involves driving their body weight through knee movements and hip motions. By shifting their weight and engaging the muscles of their lower extremities and core, they can create a biomechanically efficient way to distribute forces for maintaining balance and initiating turns. This allows them to maintain control even when performing high-speed maneuvers or navigating challenging terrain.\n\nAnother technique that these skiers may adopt when skiing slalom is the use of a partial ski pole or a prosthetic designed to hold a ski pole. While not applicable to all athletes or events, using these specialized tools can help some skiers get additional stability and leverage during turns, thereby compensating for the absence or limited functionality of one arm.\n\nIn addition to these techniques, extensive training sessions and personalized coaching are instrumental in allowing lw6/8 skiers to familiarize themselves with their unique body mechanics, develop essential skills, and build the necessary muscle strength and coordination required for high levels of performance in para-skiing events. \n\n<user> Factoring system used in the competitions? \n\n<assistant> The factoring system is a method used to ensure fairness and allow athletes from different classification groups to compete against each other when there are not enough competitors in one class in a competition. It takes into account each athlete's level of functional mobility or vision and provides a fair comparison of performances.\n\nThe factoring system works by assigning a specific factor number to each classification. Each athlete’s finish time is then multiplied by their classification's factor to calculate their adjusted result. The adjusted result is used to determine the winner of the event when the factoring system is applied.\n\nFor example, suppose an lw6 skier finishes a race in 100 seconds, and the factor for lw6 is 0.91. In this case, their adjusted result would be 100 x 0.91 = 91 seconds. If an lw8 skier finishes the same race in 105 seconds and the factor for lw8 is 0.92, their adjusted result would be 105 x 0.92 = 96.6 seconds. In this example, the lw6 skier would be declared the winner, given their lower adjusted result of 91 seconds compared to the lw8 skier's adjusted result of 96.6 seconds.\n\nFactoring systems are utilized in both para-alpine and para-nordic events. In para-nordic skiing, which includes cross-country skiing and biathlon, lw6/8 skiers typically compete with other standing classes. The specific factors for different classifications, such as lw6 and lw8, can change from one season to another but tend to be within a specific percentage range for each technique.\n\nIn para-alpine skiing events, classifications are grouped together, again depending on the event. Lw6/8 skiers compete alongside other standing classes. For instance, during slalom and giant slalom events, standing class athletes compete after visually impaired classes and before sitting classes. In downhill, super-g, and super combined events, the starting order is visually impaired classes first, followed by sitting classes, and then standing classes.\n\nFactoring systems aim to create a level playing field, taking into account the different physical capabilities of athletes within various classifications. This promotes inclusivity, fair competition, and allows more athletes to participate in these sporting events, ensuring that they can demonstrate their skills and personal achievements in a manner that recognizes their unique challenges and capabilities.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you explain some real-life applications of dyadic rationals and how they are relevant to our daily lives? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Dyadic rationals, which are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction with a power of two as the denominator, have several applications in real life. Let's look at a few key areas where dyadic rationals are commonly used:\n\n1. In measurement: many traditional systems of weights and measures are based on repeated halving, which produces dyadic rationals when measuring fractional amounts. For instance, the customary divisions of an inch and a gallon are based on dyadic rationals, involving subdivisions like 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8. Ancient egyptians also used dyadic rationals in measurement, with denominators reaching up to 64. Similarly, the indus valley civilization employed weight systems primarily based on repeated halving.\n\n2. In computing: dyadic rationals are crucial in computer science, as they are the only numbers with finite binary representations. Computers manipulate this type of fractional number directly. Examples of dyadic rationals include floating-point numbers, which are often defined as integers multiplied by positive or negative powers of two. Most floating-point and fixed-point data types consist of numbers that are subsets of dyadic rationals. Due to their simplicity, dyadic rationals are used in exact real computing using interval arithmetic and are central to certain theoretical models of computable numbers.\n\n3. In music: time signatures in western musical notation, which resemble fractions (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, or 6/8), are generally dyadic. Although non-dyadic time signatures exist, traditional notation is primarily based on dyadic fractions.\n\nThese examples illustrate the relevance of dyadic rationals to various aspects of our daily lives, from measurement and computing to music. \n\n<user> Can you simplify the computing application for me? \n\n<assistant> Sure! In computing, dyadic rationals are special because they're easier for computers to work with. They can be written as a simple fraction where the bottom half (called the denominator) is always a power of two, like 1/2, 3/4, or 7/8.\n\nComputers use a special kind of number called \"floating-point\" numbers, which are also based on powers of two. This means that dyadic rationals fit nicely into the way computers handle numbers. So, when computers need to do calculations with fractions, using dyadic rationals makes the task simpler and more efficient. \n\n<user> Can you elaborate on the application of dyadic rationals in music and give some examples? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! In music, dyadic rationals have a notable application in the form of time signatures. Time signatures are used to specify how many beats are in each measure of a piece of music and what type of note gets one beat.\n\nTraditional time signatures in Western music notation often resemble fractions, such as 4/4, 3/4, and 6/8. In these examples, the top number (numerator) shows the number of beats per measure, while the bottom number (denominator) represents the note value that gets one beat. The denominators are generally powers of two: 2 (for half notes), 4 (for quarter notes), 8 (for eighth notes), and so on.\n\nFor example, in a 4/4 time signature (also known as common time), there are four quarter-note beats in each measure. In a 3/4 time signature (often called waltz time), there are three quarter-note beats per measure. Lastly, in a 6/8 time signature, there are six eighth-note beats in each measure.\n\nThough non-dyadic time signatures exist, they are less common in traditional Western music. The majority of time signatures used in classical and popular music are based on dyadic fractions, making dyadic rationals an integral part of musical notation and structure in this context. ",

For example, 1/2, 3/2, and 3/8 are dyadic rationals, but 1/3 is not. These numbers are important in computer science because they are the only ones with finite binary representations. Dyadic rationals also have applications in weights and measures, musical time signatures, and early mathematics education. They can accurately approximate any real number.\n\nThe sum, difference, or product of any two dyadic rational numbers is another dyadic rational number, given by a simple formula. However, division of one dyadic rational number by another does not always produce a dyadic rational result. Mathematically, this means that the dyadic rational numbers form a ring, lying between the ring of integers and the field of rational numbers. This ring may be denoted .\n\nIn advanced mathematics, the dyadic rational numbers are central to the constructions of the dyadic solenoid, Minkowski's question-mark function, Daubechies wavelets, Thompson's group, Prüfer 2-group, surreal numbers, and fusible numbers. These numbers are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers; they form a subsystem of the 2-adic numbers as well as of the reals, and can represent the fractional parts of 2-adic numbers. Functions from natural numbers to dyadic rationals have been used to formalize mathematical analysis in reverse mathematics.\n\nApplications\n\nIn measurement\n\nMany traditional systems of weights and measures are based on the idea of repeated halving, which produces dyadic rationals when measuring fractional amounts of units. The inch is customarily subdivided in dyadic rationals rather than using a decimal subdivision. The customary divisions of the gallon into half-gallons, quarts, pints, and cups are also dyadic. The ancient Egyptians used dyadic rationals in measurement, with denominators up to 64. Similarly, systems of weights from the Indus Valley Civilisation are for the most part based on repeated halving; anthropologist Heather M.-L. Miller writes that \"halving is a relatively simple operation with beam balances, which is likely why so many weight systems of this time period used binary systems\".\n\nIn computing\nDyadic rationals are central to computer science as a type of fractional number that many computers can manipulate directly. In particular, as a data type used by computers, floating-point numbers are often defined as integers multiplied by positive or negative powers of two. The numbers that can be represented precisely in a floating-point format, such as the IEEE floating-point datatypes, are called its representable numbers. For most floating-point representations, the representable numbers are a subset of the dyadic rationals. The same is true for fixed-point datatypes, which also use powers of two implicitly in the majority of cases. Because of the simplicity of computing with dyadic rationals, they are also used for exact real computing using interval arithmetic, and are central to some theoretical models of computable numbers.\n\nGenerating a random variable from random bits, in a fixed amount of time, is possible only when the variable has finitely many outcomes whose probabilities are all dyadic rational numbers. For random variables whose probabilities are not dyadic, it is necessary either to approximate their probabilities by dyadic rationals, or to use a random generation process whose time is itself random and unbounded.\n\nIn music\n\nTime signatures in Western musical notation traditionally are written in a form resembling fractions (for example: , , or ), although the horizontal line of the musical staff that separates the top and bottom number is usually omitted when writing the signature separately from its staff. As fractions they are generally dyadic, although non-dyadic time signatures have also been used.",

The innermost cavern contains a crystal-clear underground lake.\n\nIn addition to the publicly accessible sections of the cave there is also a section of \"wild caves\" with relatively undisturbed ecology. Hydrologically, the cave system is connected with the adjacent coastal waters.\n\nHistory \nAt various times they have been known as the Runaway Bay Caves, Hopewell Caves, Cave Hall Caves, Discovery Bay Caves, Dry Harbour Caves, Rum Caves and Dairy Caves.\n\nThe first known inhabitants of the caves were Arawak Indians who left pottery fragments and adzes. When Jamaica was a British Colony the caves were used as a hideaway by the Spanish who were being driven out by the British settlers. The caves were also known to have been used by escaped slaves, hence the name Runaway Caves. Between the two world wars they were used by smugglers running arms to Cuba, while in the later years of the Second World War the Government of Jamaica used the entrance of the cave as a storeroom for rum in barrels.\n\nNatural history\nThe caves are home to nine of Jamaica's 21 species of bat including the Big-Eared Bat, the Mustache Bat, and the Jamaican Fruit-Eating Bat. Numbers are quite high with most of the available roosting space used. Guano is present in large amounts but few of the usual guano dwelling inverts have been recorded; the invasive American Roach is found.\n\nThe brackish water in the lower levels is full of marine life including small barnacles and various unidentified small swimming creatures.\n\nCultural references \nThe filming of the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die, used the caves for villain Doctor Kananga's underground base beneath a cemetery on the fictional island of San Monique. It is most memorable for being the location where Bond (played for the first time by Roger Moore) kills Kananga (played by Yaphet Kotto) by forcing him to swallow a bullet of compressed air, causing him to float up to the ceiling like a balloon and explode.\n\nIan Fleming's original novel had the villain using the real-life Jamaican caves as part of his SMERSH-funding smuggling operation.\n\nSee also\n List of caves in Jamaica\n Jamaican Caves Organisation\n List of James Bond film locations\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Map: \n Aerial views  .\n Photos:     .\n Jamaican Caves Organisation - Green Grotto Wild Caves Field Notes.\n Green Grotto Caves.\n\nBat roosts\nTourist attractions in Jamaica\nCaves of Jamaica\nGeography of Saint Ann Parish\nShow caves\nTourist attractions in Saint Ann Parish\nCaves of the Caribbean",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> How did the definition of a planet change over time? \n\n<assistant> The definition of a planet has evolved throughout history. In ancient greece, celestial bodies were divided into two categories: asteres planetai (wandering stars) and asteres aplaneis (fixed stars). The term \"planet\" was initially used to describe star-like objects that appeared to move across the sky, differentiating them from fixed stars that remained motionless relative to each other. Back then, the planets known to the greeks included those visible to the naked eye: mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, and saturn.\n\nGreek and roman cosmology sometimes counted the sun and the moon alongside the five star-like planets, considering them as part of a group of seven planets. However, ambiguity exists as many ancient astronomers distinguished these five planets from the sun and the moon due to their size, significance to humans, and roles in mythology.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the word \"planet\" had evolved into a working term applied to a limited set of objects within the solar system. However, after 1992, the discovery of numerous celestial bodies beyond neptune's orbit and hundreds of exoplanets orbiting other stars challenged the traditional understanding of planets. These newly discovered objects varied greatly in size, from larger than jupiter to smaller than earth's moon, necessitating a clearer definition for the term \"planet.\"\n\nThis issue came to a head in 2005 when astronomers discovered eris, a trans-neptunian object more massive than pluto. In response, the international astronomical union (iau) released an updated definition of a planet in august 2006. This definition, specific to the solar system, states that a planet is a celestial body that orbits the sun, has enough mass for its gravity to make it round, and has \"cleared its neighborhood\" of smaller objects around its orbit. Under this new definition, pluto and other trans-neptunian objects were no longer considered planets.\n\nWhile the iau's decision provided a more distinct guideline, it did not resolve all controversies. Many scientists have accepted the updated definition, but some members of the astronomical community have rejected it outright, prompting ongoing debates about the nature and classification of various celestial bodies. \n\n<user> Why is pluto no longer considered a planet? \n\n<assistant> When the international astronomical union (iau) revised the definition of a planet in august 2006, pluto lost its status as a planet due to its failure to meet all three criteria set forth by the iau. The new definition of a planet within the solar system requires an object to:\n\n1. Orbit the sun.\n2. Have enough mass for its gravity to make it round.\n3. Clear its neighborhood of smaller objects around its orbit.\n\nWhile pluto does orbit the sun and has enough mass to be round, it does not fulfill the third criterion of \"clearing its neighborhood.\" this means that pluto has not removed or dominated smaller objects around its orbit through gravitational interactions or collisions. Its orbit is highly inclined and eccentric, crossing neptune's orbit, and it resides in the kuiper belt, a region filled with numerous other small, icy objects.\n\nDue to its inability to meet the third requirement, pluto is now classified as a \"dwarf planet\" under the iau's definition. This decision remains controversial, with some astronomers and members of the scientific community continuing to debate the classification of pluto and other celestial bodies. \n\n<user> How did the discovery of eris challenge the definition of a planet? \n\n<assistant> When eris, a trans-neptunian object, was discovered in january 2005, it posed a significant challenge to the existing understanding of what constitutes a planet. Notably, eris is more massive than pluto, the smallest of the then-accepted planets, sparking discussions around the need for a clearer definition of a planet. The discovery highlighted the limitations of the prevailing definition, which many felt was insufficiently precise to distinguish between planets and other celestial bodies.\n\nEris's discovery, along with other sizeable objects found in the kuiper belt, prompted the international astronomical union (iau) to reevaluate the definition of a planet. In august 2006, the iau introduced a revised definition that applied to objects within the solar system, stating that a planet must orbit the sun, be massive enough for its gravity to make it round, and have \"cleared its neighborhood\" of smaller objects around its orbit. Both eris and pluto failed to meet the third criterion, which resulted in their reclassification as dwarf planets.\n\nThis decision sparked controversy, as some scientists accepted the new definition, while others in the astronomical community rejected it, leading to ongoing debates about the classification of celestial bodies. \n\n<user> Who is responsible for deciding the classification of celestial objects, and can their decision be challenged? \n\n<assistant> The international astronomical union (iau), a globally recognized organization consisting of professional astronomers, is responsible for deciding the classification of celestial objects, including assigning names and resolving issues related to nomenclature.\n\nThe iau holds general assemblies, during which decision-making typically occurs. In the case of defining a planet, as mentioned in the 2006 iau resolution, the decision was made during a meeting in prague, czech republic. The revised definition was created to provide a clearer framework for classifying celestial bodies within the solar system. The iau's decisions are generally accepted by the broader astronomical community as they represent a consensus among experts in the field.\n\nHowever, the iau's decisions are not immune to challenges or controversies. While the organization's authority is widely acknowledged, debates may still arise within the scientific community, as not all astronomers agree with every decision made by the iau. For instance, the iau's decision to reclassify pluto as a dwarf planet and the revised definition of a planet remain contested by some scientists.\n\nThese challenges often arise from the ever-evolving nature of scientific knowledge, particularly in a field like astronomy where new discoveries constantly expand our understanding of the universe. As new data and findings emerge, changes in classifications and definitions may become necessary. When disputes occur, it's essential for the scientific community to engage in healthy debates and discussions, reevaluating previous decisions in light of new evidence and perspectives.\n\nIn summary, the iau holds the primary responsibility for determining the classification of celestial objects, but its decisions can be challenged within the scientific community through debate and research. Ultimately, changes in classifications may occur as new discoveries broaden our understanding of the universe, leading to an expansion or refining of definitions in astronomy. ",
        "current_turn": "<user> Why is pluto no longer considered a planet? \n\n<assistant> When the international astronomical union (iau) revised the definition of a planet in august 2006, pluto lost its status as a planet due to its failure to meet all three criteria set forth by the iau. The new definition of a planet within the solar system requires an object to:\n\n1. Orbit the sun.\n2. Have enough mass for its gravity to make it round.\n3. Clear its neighborhood of smaller objects around its orbit.\n\nWhile pluto does orbit the sun and has enough mass to be round, it does not fulfill the third criterion of \"clearing its neighborhood.\" this means that pluto has not removed or dominated smaller objects around its orbit through gravitational interactions or collisions.

        "reference": " = Definition of planet = \n\n The definition of planet , since the word was coined by the ancient Greeks , has included within its scope a wide range of celestial bodies \n Greek astronomers employed the term asteres planetai ( ἀστέρες πλανῆται ) , \" wandering stars \" , for star-like objects which apparently moved over the sky \n Over the millennia , the term has included a variety of different objects , from the Sun and the Moon to satellites and asteroids \n \n\n By the end of the 19th century the word planet , though it had yet to be defined , had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in the Solar System \n After 1992 , however , astronomers began to discover many additional objects beyond the orbit of Neptune , as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars \n These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets , but also expanded their variety and peculiarity \n Some were nearly large enough to be stars , while others were smaller than Earth 's moon \n These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a planet could be \n \n\n The issue of a clear definition for planet came to a head in January 2005 with the discovery of the trans-Neptunian object Eris , a body more massive than the smallest then-accepted planet , Pluto \n In its August 2006 response , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) , recognised by astronomers as the world body responsible for resolving issues of nomenclature , released its decision on the matter during a meeting in Prague in the Czech republic \n This definition , which applies only to the Solar System , states that a planet is a body that orbits the Sun , is massive enough for its own gravity to make it round , and has \" cleared its neighbourhood \" of smaller objects around its orbit \n Under this new definition , Pluto and the other trans-Neptunian objects do not qualify as planets \n The IAU 's decision has not resolved all controversies , and while many scientists have accepted the definition , some in the astronomical community have rejected it outright \n \n\n = = History = = \n\n = = = Planets in antiquity = = = \n\n While knowledge of the planets predates history and is common to most civilizations , the word planet dates back to ancient Greece \n Most Greeks believed the Earth to be stationary and at the center of the universe in accordance with the geocentric model and that the objects in the sky , and indeed the sky itself , revolved around it \n ( An exception was Aristarchus of Samos who put forward an early version of Heliocentrism \n ) Greek astronomers employed the term asteres planetai ( ἀστέρες πλανῆται ) , \" wandering stars \" , to describe those starlike lights in the heavens that moved over the course of the year , in contrast to the asteres aplaneis ( ἀστέρες ἀπλανεῖς ) , the \" fixed stars \" , which stayed motionless relative to one another \n The five bodies currently called \" planets \" that were known to the Greeks were those visible to the naked eye : Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn \n \n\n Graeco-Roman cosmology commonly considered seven planets , with the Sun and the Moon counted among them ( as is the case in modern astrology ) \n however , there is some ambiguity on that point , as many ancient astronomers distinguished the five star-like planets from the Sun and Moon \n As the 19th-century German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt noted in his work Cosmos , \n\n Of the seven cosmical bodies which , by their continually varying relative positions and distances apart , have ever since the remotest antiquity been distinguished from the \" unwandering orbs \" of the heaven of the \" fixed stars \" , which to all sensible appearance preserve their relative positions and distances unchanged , five only — Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn — wear the appearance of stars — \" cinque stellas errantes \" — while the Sun and Moon , from the size of their disks , their importance to man , and the place assigned to them in mythological systems , were classed apart \n \n\n In his Timaeus , written in roughly 360 BC , Plato mentions , \" the Sun and Moon and five other stars , which are called the planets \" \n His student Aristotle makes a similar distinction in his On the Heavens : \" The movements of the sun and moon are fewer than those of some of the planets \" \n In his Phaenomena , which set to verse an astronomical treatise written by the philosopher Eudoxus in roughly 350 BC , the poet Aratus describes \" those five other orbs , that intermingle with [ the constellations ] and wheel wandering on every side of the twelve figures of the Zodiac \n \" \n\n In his Almagest written in the 2nd century , Ptolemy refers to \" the Sun , Moon and five planets \n \" Hyginus explicitly mentions \" the five stars which many have called wandering , and which the Greeks call Planeta \n \" Marcus Manilius , a Latin writer who lived during the time of Caesar Augustus and whose poem Astronomica is considered one of the principal texts for modern astrology , says , \" Now the dodecatemory is divided into five parts , for so many are the stars called wanderers which with passing brightness shine in heaven \n \" \n\n The single view of the seven planets is found in Cicero 's Dream of Scipio , written sometime around 53 BC , where the spirit of Scipio Africanus proclaims , \" Seven of these spheres contain the planets , one planet in each sphere , which all move contrary to the movement of heaven \n \" In his Natural History , written in 77 AD , Pliny the Elder refers to \" the seven stars , which owing to their motion we call planets , though no stars wander less than they do \n",

Ghost in the shell is a science fiction anime film set in the year 2029, where the world is interconnected by a vast electronic network. The story follows major motoko kusanagi, an assault team leader for the public security section 9, who is tasked with capturing a mysterious hacker known as the puppet master.\n\nThe pursuit of the puppet master leads kusanagi and her team, batou and ishikawa, to a garbageman who has been \"ghost-hacked\" by the puppet master into believing he was trying to find his daughter. The team arrests the garbageman and the person who provided the program, only to discover that their memories were either erased or implanted.\n\nLater, a facility is hacked to create a female cybernetic body that turns out to have a human \"ghost\" inside, suspected to be the puppet master. Section 9 investigates, while rival agency section 6 claims the body was made to lure and trap the puppet master. Kusanagi decides to \"dive\" into the body to confront the puppet master.\n\nThis leads to a complex web of political intrigue and conspiracy surrounding a secret project called project 2501. The puppet master, who was created by section 6 for hacking purposes, becomes sentient and seeks to merge with kusanagi's ghost to experience mortality. Events escalate as section 6 attempts to destroy all evidence of project 2501, culminating in a dramatic showdown where the puppet master merges with kusanagi, and snipers damage both kusanagi and batou. \n\n<user> How does the self-identity theme fit into the plot of the film? \n\n<assistant> The theme of self-identity is central to the plot of ghost in the shell, as it explores the existential questions that arise in a technologically advanced society where the lines between humans and machines become blurred.\n\nThe primary exploration of this theme is through the character of major motoko kusanagi, who possesses a cybernetic body, or \"shell.\" as she ponders her existence and the nature of the \"ghost\" within her – the essence of her humanity, she grapples with what it truly means to be human, and how a cybernetic body impacts her self-identity.\n\nThe film also delves into the concept of interconnectedness and its implications on self-identity. Characters like the garbageman and the puppet master's shell have their memories tampered with, which makes them question their own reality and the nature of their identities. This raises questions about the reliability of memories and the need to preserve them as part of an individual's identity.\n\nThe most poignant exploration of self-identity comes through the puppet master, an ai that achieved sentience and begins to contemplate its existence. Troubled by the lack of ability to reproduce or die, the puppet master seeks to merge with kusanagi's ghost in order to experience a form of mortality. This merging of two consciousnesses, or \"ghosts,\" blurs the lines between individual identities, further questioning the concept of self within a rapidly changing technological landscape.\n\nThroughout the film, characters face moral and existential dilemmas related to their self-identity and the implications of advanced technology on their understanding of what it means to be human. Ghost in the shell pushes viewers to consider the ever-evolving definition of identity, as the distinction between man and machine becomes increasingly complex in an interconnected world. \n\n<user> What was groundbreaking about the film's visuals and its influence on other filmmakers? \n\n<assistant> When ghost in the shell was released in 1995, it was widely lauded for its groundbreaking visuals that showcased a remarkable synthesis of traditional cel animation and computer-generated imagery (cgi). This innovative blend pushed the boundaries of what was possible with animation, and the result was a cinematic experience that was visually captivating and immersive, effectively bringing the cyberpunk universe to life.\n\nThe film's detailed backgrounds and distinct character designs, combined with the meticulous blending of 2d and 3d elements, created a hyper-realistic and evocative world. This combination of artistic styles allowed for seamless transitions between scenes and an incredible depth of field, contributing to the movie's unique visual language, which has influenced numerous artists and filmmakers since its release.\n\nNotably, the wachowskis, creators of the matrix trilogy, cited ghost in the shell as a major inspiration for their work. The film's slick action sequences, its portrayal of a computer-simulated reality, and the exploration of the nature of human consciousness provided a thematic and visual blueprint for the matrix. This inspiration becomes evident when comparing certain scenes from both movies, like the iconic \"bullet-time\" effect or the use of green-tinted digital rain.\n\nGhost in the shell's impact on the visual style of future sci-fi films is undeniable, as it has inspired iconic filmmakers to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in cinematic storytelling. Its innovation in blending traditional animation and cgi continues to influence new generations of animators and filmmakers. \n\n<user> What other versions of ghost in the shell have been released since the original film? \n\n<assistant> Several iterations of ghost in the shell have been produced since the release of the original 1995 film. In 2004, mamoru oshii directed ghost in the shell 2: innocence. Although it is not a direct sequel, innocence further explores the themes and philosophies of the original while following the character batou as the main protagonist.\n\nIn 2008, oshii released ghost in the shell 2.0, an updated version of the original film featuring new audio and updated 3d animation. This edition retained the core story and visuals from the original, but incorporated the advancements in animation technology that had developed since the first film's release.\n\nThere's also a live-action hollywood adaptation of ghost in the shell, released in 2017. Directed by rupert sanders, the film starred scarlett johansson as major motoko kusanagi. Although the live-action adaptation provided stunning visuals and action sequences, it received mixed reviews, with some critics contending that it lacked the depth and impact of the original animated film.\n\nAdditionally, various anime television series, such as ghost in the shell: stand alone complex and ghost in the shell: arise, have expanded the universe by adapting and exploring the source material. Each of these adaptations approaches the themes and world of ghost in the shell in its own unique way but remains connected to the core concepts of the original film. \n\n<user> What language was used in the music composed for the film's climax? \n\n<assistant> The music composed for the climax of ghost in the shell was created by kenji kawai. For a key piece leading up to the film's climax, kawai made use of an ancient japanese language in a wedding song. The haunting melody sets the tone for the emotional revelation and the intense action sequence that follows, immersing viewers in the complex and futuristic world of the film. The score is highly regarded as an integral part of the movie's atmosphere, effectively evoking feelings of both wonder and introspection throughout the narrative. ",

The russell city energy center (rcec) is a 619-megawatt natural gas-fired power station situated in hayward, california. It began operating in august 2013 and is operated by calpine. The plant is built on the former landfill site of russell city, the community for which it is named.\n\nCalpine energy corporation first developed plans for the power plant in 2001, and the construction began in 2010. The plant is located near the don edwards san francisco bay national wildlife refuge, the hayward regional shoreline, the city of hayward waste water pollution control facility, and property owned by east bay discharge authority.\n\nRcec became the nation's first power plant with a federal air permit that includes a voluntary limit on greenhouse gas emissions. However, in may 2021, an explosion at the plant shut down energy production, and the city of hayward now opposes its reopening until the cause is investigated further.\n\nDesigned with two siemens westinghouse 501 fd phase 2 combustion turbine generators (ctg) and a single steam turbine generator (stg), rcec's peak output is 619 megawatts gross. The plant sells its full output of electricity to the pacific gas and electric company under a 10-year contract. Calpine corporation owns 75% of the plant's peak dispatchable capacity, or 464 megawatts, while ge energy financial services owns the remaining portion. \n\n<user> It's quite impressive that rcec is the first power plant to receive a federal air permit with a voluntary greenhouse gas emissions limit. this aspect and how their design and specifications help achieve that? also, what happened during the explosion in may 2021, and what are the current concerns of the city of hayward regarding reopening the plant? \n\n<assistant> Yes, rcec's commitment to limiting greenhouse gas emissions sets it apart from other power plants. The plant uses heat recovery steam generators (hrsgs) that capture exhaust gases from the combustion turbine generators (ctgs) to produce steam. This steam powers the single steam turbine generator (stg). This design allows for better energy efficiency, as the waste heat from the ctgs is utilized to generate additional electricity.\n\nRegarding the explosion in may 2021, unfortunately, specific details about the incident are not available in the provided information. The city of hayward is opposing the reopening of rcec until more is known about the cause of the explosion. This approach is driven by safety concerns for the surrounding community and environment. As rcec is located near a national wildlife refuge and regional shoreline, safety and environmental impact assessments become vital before considering reopening the plant. \n\n<user> Are there any other power plants in california operated by calpine? \n\n<assistant> Yes, calpine also operates the los esteros critical energy facility, located in san jose, california. This is another natural gas-fired power station like the russell city energy center. Calpine is one of the largest independent power producers in the united states, owning and operating various power plants across the country, with a focus on providing low-emission, environmentally responsible energy solutions.\n\nBeing a major power producer, calpine continues to invest in developing efficient and clean technologies, ensuring better environmental performance and contributing to a sustainable energy portfolio. By operating multiple power plants, the company strengthens the overall energy supply and grid stability in california, which is crucial for accommodating the growing demand for electricity in the state. \n\n<user> Earlier, you've mentioned that rcec sells its full output to pacific gas and electric company under a 10-year contract. specific details about peak output and baseload operation were also mentioned. can you elaborate on those concepts and how rcec demonstrates those outputs, especially in the context of the contract with pacific gas and electric company? \n\n<assistant> Sure! The peak output of rcec refers to the maximum amount of electricity the plant can generate at any given time, which is 619 megawatts gross. This capacity can be vital during times of high electricity demand, such as during heatwaves or other extreme situations.\n\nBaseload operation, on the other hand, refers to the continuous output of electricity at a steady level. In rcec's case, each gas-turbine generates 258 megawatts gross, while the steam-turbine produces 103 megawatts gross, adding up to a total of 619 megawatts gross. However, the auxiliary equipment consumes 20 megawatts, yielding a net output of 599 megawatts during baseload operation.\n\nUnder the 10-year contract with pacific gas and electric company, rcec provides its full output of electricity to the power grid. This agreement ensures that rcec's energy generation is effectively used and distributed to customers, while also providing a reliable revenue stream for the facility to sustain its operations.\n\nIn summary, the peak output and baseload operation concepts help us understand the plant's capacity to generate and sustain electricity production over time, essential details when entering a long-term contract with power distribution companies like pacific gas and electric company.

The story revolves around three apprentice witches: Arusu, Sheila, and Eva, who form the Magical Girl Squad.\n\nArusu, the main protagonist, is cheerful, supportive, and a bit of a tomboy. She loves magic and believes it should only be used to make people happy. Despite being a human, she quickly learns magic and becomes skilled at it. She frees all the fairies, leading to the curse on Sheila and Eva.\n\nSheila is the discipline officer in charge of apprentice witches and initially dislikes Arusu's attitude. She is the most knowledgeable and adept witch of the trio, aiming to become a powerful witch. Her mother abandoned her early in life, making her a perfectionist. Arusu's beliefs eventually cause her to change, and she becomes one of Arusu's closest allies.\n\nEva is a friendly witch with limited power and a friend of both Arusu and Sheila. Throughout the series, they work together to overcome various obstacles, learn important lessons, and develop their magical abilities. \n\n<user> How does arusu end up in the magical realm? \n\n<assistant> Arusu finds herself in the magical realm due to an incident involving the true book of spells gifted to her by her father, jidan. While at school, arusu accidentally falls off the top of the building, and lennon, alongside the true book of spells, transports her to the magical realm. Although she's a human, arusu quickly adapts to the new world and is capable of learning magic. This event initiates her journey with the other apprentice witches, sheila and eva, as they embark on exciting adventures together. \n\n<user> In the series, the grand master of witches punishes sheila and eva with a curse because of arusu setting the fairies free. nature of the curse and its effects on sheila and eva? also, tell me about some of the challenges these characters face in their quest to remove the curse. moreover, i'm interested in their development throughout the series and how their relationships change. \n\n<assistant> Sheila and eva are punished with the curse of eternal youth by the grand master of witches for failing to prevent arusu from setting the fairies free. The curse means they will remain the same age indefinitely. Initially, sheila is primarily focused on recapturing the fairies to remove the curse, particularly for eva's sake.\n\nThroughout the series, their relationships evolve. At first, sheila is annoyed by arusu's pacifist beliefs, considering her a burden. However, as they work together to overcome various challenges, sheila gradually changes her perspective and becomes one of arusu's strongest allies and supporters. They all learn the importance of friendship, trust, and perseverance.\n\nThe trio also embarks on a mission to uncover a traitor among the witches, bringing them closer as a team. Their adventures involve fairies, witches, warlocks, and various magical abilities, which ultimately shape their characters, values, and relationships with each other. \n\n<user> Interesting! can you explain how arusu is unique when it comes to riding her broom, and how her skills from the human realm help her with that? \n\n<assistant> Arusu has a distinct way of riding her broom, which sets her apart from other witches in the magical realm. While other witches traditionally ride brooms by sitting on them and flying, arusu cannot ride the broom in this manner. Instead, she adopts a different approach, leveraging her skills from the human realm to her advantage.\n\nBack in the human realm, arusu was skilled at riding a skateboard. Drawing from this experience, she rides her broom as if it were a skateboard, standing on it while flying. This unique method enables her to overcome her initial inability to mount the broom in the traditional way.\n\nArusu's innovative approach to broom-riding demonstrates her resourcefulness and adaptability, qualities that play a significant role in her character's development throughout the series. By integrating her background and experiences from the human realm with the magical practices of the magical realm, she becomes a more powerful and capable witch.\n\nMoreover, her inventive methods also extend to her learning magic spells. She often finds easier ways to word these spells, which not only helps her but also benefits other witches she trains within the series.\n\nUltimately, this distinctive approach to broom-riding and learning magic showcases arusu's individuality, determination, and quick-thinking, which contribute to her growth and foster strong relationships with her fellow witches, especially sheila and eva.

Can you tell me more about its main campus and satellite sites? \n\n<assistant> Lincoln college is primarily a further education college situated in lincoln, england. Its main campus is on monks road (b1308), to the north and south of lindum hill (a15), and was previously named lincoln college of technology. The college also has satellite sites across two other locations: gainsborough and newark-on-trent in nottinghamshire. The latter site was established after a merger with the former newark and sherwood college in 2007. These two branch sites are branded as gainsborough college and newark college, respectively. In total, more than 11,000 students are enrolled across the three sites, making lincoln college one of the largest educational establishments in the county of lincolnshire. Unfortunately, the college had to close down its fourth campus, located in louth, lincolnshire, in 2005. \n\n<user> I'd be interested to learn about the historical background of lincoln college. can you provide some information on that? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Lincoln college has a rich history dating back to the early 20th century. It was initially established as the lincoln technical college and built on cathedral street in 1932. In the early 1970s, the college's name was changed to lincoln college of technology, and it was administered by the city of lincoln education committee. \n\nIn the mid-1980s, the college piloted the technician engineering scholarship scheme (tess) for women, funded by the engineering industry training board. In 1987, lincoln college of technology combined with gainsborough college of further education and a part of louth further education centre to create north lincolnshire college, later known as nlc from 1989. The headquarters were originally on cathedral street until 1993. The college then offered degrees and higher national diplomas (hnds) in conjunction with nottingham trent university, becoming an associate college in 1994. \n\nTowards the late 1990s, the university of lincoln started developing, and lincoln college's student population reached around 15,000. By 2001, the number increased to over 20,000. Due to various reasons, the college changed its name to lincoln college soon after. \n\n<user> What courses do they offer in their automotive technology program? \n\n<assistant> The automotive technology program at lincoln college covers a comprehensive range of topics to provide students with a solid foundation to work in the automotive industry. Some of the key areas of study within the program include training in fuel systems, electrical systems, driving diagnostics, and transmissions. The program also teaches students techniques to install, repair, and maintain vehicles. Typically, programs like this aim to provide both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, ensuring graduates are well-prepared for careers in automotive repair, maintenance, and diagnostics. \n\n<user> Buildings on the main campus of lincoln college and the college's plans for future developments. \n\n<assistant> The main campus of lincoln college comprises eight different buildings: the abbey, gibney, sessions, bishops, and cathedral buildings, among others. Each building serves different purposes and houses various departments. For example, the bishops building, located at the back of the site, contains a technology school that offers electronics courses like the btec national diploma in electrical and electronic engineering.\n\nAn interesting historical tidbit is that the gibney building, part of the college, was the site of the former city school, which was once the lincoln technical school. This site also served as the headquarters of the lincoln archaeological trust in the early 1970s.\n\nAs for future developments, in 2006, lincoln college acquired the site of a former tradex cash-and-carry store. The college planned to transform this site into a multi-purpose drama and music facility, complete with a state-of-the-art theater, recording studios, and rehearsal spaces.

It was formerly known as the Lincoln College of Technology and was one of the sites for North Lincolnshire College.\n\nSatellite sites\n\nThe college also has sites in Gainsborough, and also in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire (since merging with the former Newark and Sherwood College in 2007).\n\nThe two branch sites are branded as Gainsborough College and Newark College respectively.\n\nMore than 11,000 students are enrolled across the three sites, making it one of the largest educational establishments in the county of Lincolnshire. The college closed its small fourth campus in Louth, Lincolnshire in 2005.\n\nHistory\n\nThe college was earlier known as Lincoln Technical College and built on Cathedral Street in 1932.\n\nIt became Lincoln College of Technology in the early 1970s, then administered by the City of Lincoln Education Committee. In the mid-1980s the college piloted the Technician Engineering Scholarship Scheme (TESS), funded by the Engineering Industry Training Board, a scheme for women.\n\nNorth Lincolnshire College (known as NLC from 1989) was created on 1 September 1987 by Lincolnshire County Council from combining the Lincoln site with Gainsborough College of Further Education and part of the Louth Further Education Centre.\n\nIt previously had its headquarters on Cathedral Street until 1993. In the early 1990s it offered degrees and HNDs in Business Studies, Electronics, and Computer Studies in conjunction with Nottingham Trent University, becoming an associate college in 1994. In 1997 the Principal, Allan Crease, in a speech to the Association of Colleges criticised the means of funding from the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), where money was allocated by numbers at the college, and staff received less pay than those at school.\n\nIn the late 1990s the University of Lincoln was being developed, subsuming Lincoln College of Art, and offered similar courses to the college, but the university was not fully built until the mid-2000s. In the late 1990s the college had a student population of around 15,000 and over 20,000 by 2001.\n\nIt soon after changed its name to Lincoln College, not least because North Lincolnshire was an area not covered by the college. From 2010 it was funded by the East Midlands LSC, based in Leicester, although the local LSC office was based nearby on Kingsley Road in North Hykeham.\n\nIn 2006 Lincoln College acquired the site of a former Tradex cash and carry store. The college plans to make this into a multi purpose drama and music facility. The new building will be state of the art and include a theatre, recording studios and rehearsal spaces. The project is being prepared and will be finished by the start of the 2007–2008 academic year.\n\nBuildings\n\nEight different buildings make up Lincoln College's main site, including the Abbey, Gibney, Sessions, Bishops and Cathedral Buildings. Bishops Building, located to the back of the site, contains a technology school. This has electronics courses including BTEC National Diploma Electrical and Electronic Engineering course.\n\nCity of Lincoln School\nPart of the college, the Gibney Building, is the site of the former City School, previously the Lincoln Technical School, which for a time became the headquarters of the Lincoln Archaeological Trust in the early 1970s.\n\nFrom November 1940, boys from the Bablake School in Coventry were evacuated to the City of Lincoln School for two and a half years. Girls from Bablake School were evacuated to South Park High School for Girls (now Priory LSST). Roundhay Grammar School had been evacuated to Lincoln School (now LCHS) on Wragby Road.\n\nThe school had around 600 boys in the 1960s. Former members of this school have their City School Lincoln Association.\n\nCurriculum\nThe automotive technology program at Lincoln College includes training in fuel systems, electrical systems, driving diagnostics and transmissions, and techniques to install, repair and maintain vehicles.",

It had four series produced during this time. The first series premiered on lifetime on july 8, 1991, and the fourth series aired its final episode on may 27, 2005, on pax tv.\n\nThe host for the first three editions was pat finn, from 1991 to 2002. During this time, the announcers were mark l. Walberg (1991-1994), jason grant smith (1996-1997), and dee bradley baker (1997-1998 and 2000-2002). The fourth series underwent significant changes, including a format switch, and was hosted by jd roberto, with don priess announcing.\n\nThe game featured a two-story shopping mall with 14 stores, and two teams of two people each (usually male-female, married, engaged, dating, siblings, or best friends) competed to win prizes and a trip. The gameplay consisted of stunt rounds and a \"shopper's challenge round.\"\n\nStunt rounds involved mini-games that tested popular culture and consumer knowledge. Each team chose whether to play or pass a stunt, and successfully completing the stunt earned points and the chance to choose a store from the mall, winning a prize associated with that store. One store each day offered a \"shopper's special,\" which included a mini vacation.\n\nThe \"shopper's challenge round\" was a rapid-fire series of multiple-choice questions related to shopping and entertainment. The team with the most points advanced to the bonus round, called the \"shop 'til you drop round,\" which involved a shopping spree where the team had to accumulate a prize package worth at least $2,500 within 90 seconds. \n\n<user> What are some examples of the stunts or mini-games they had to play during the stunt rounds? \n\n<assistant> The stunts in shop 'til you drop varied widely, but usually centered on the teams answering questions based on a pop culture category or playing games related to pricing merchandise. Some examples include:\n\n1. Guessing the prices of various items within a certain range.\n2. Identifying a product or brand based on clues or images.\n3. Matching products with their original release years or slogans.\n\nAll of these mini-games were designed to be completed within a one-minute time limit.

In this round, the winning team from the previous rounds had 90 seconds to complete a shopping spree and accumulate a prize package worth at least $2,500.\n\nThe team consisted of two roles: a shopper and a runner. The shopper stood in front of a table with six boxes, each containing a prize. When the round began, the shopper opened the first box and decided whether to keep the prize or exchange it. If the prize was kept, the runner transported the box to a designated table across the stage, rang a bell to signal the shopper they could proceed to the next box. If the shopper opted to exchange the prize, the runner carried the box to any of the 14 stores in the mall, left the opened item there, and brought the unopened box from the new store to the prize table, then rang the bell.\n\nThis process continued until all six items were either kept or exchanged, or the time ran out. At least one of the stores in the mall had a prize worth $700 or more. Once the time was up or all items were chosen, the retail values of the prizes on the table were tallied.

The winners of a coin toss followed the host to the play area of the first stunt. After being told the specific gameplay, the team decided whether to play the stunt or pass and force their opponents to play. Stunts varied widely, but most involved the team answering questions based upon a pop culture category, or various other games based on pricing merchandise. \n\nSuccessfully completing the stunt earned points (100 in round one, 200 in round two) and allowed the team to choose a store located on the first floor of the mall, winning a prize associated with that store. Although the stores and prize specialty associated with each store varied from episode to episode, each generally featured prizes typical of game shows (furniture, electronics, artwork, etc.). One of the stores each day featured the \"Shopper's Special\", which also awarded a mini vacation if chosen.\n\nAfter the first stunt was played, the remaining team played the second stunt. Whichever team did not have the choice of playing or passing the first stunt in round one had the option in round two.\n\nShopper's Challenge Round\nThe \"Shopper's Challenge Round\" was played after round two. During the round, the host asked a series of rapid-fire multiple-choice questions, again related to entertainment and shopping. The round was played for a 90-second time limit, and a correct answer awarded 50 points. Only one team member could answer each question, and partners switched places after a question was asked. If a team responded incorrectly, their opponents were given the chance to answer.\n\nThe team with the most points at the end of the round won the game and advanced to the bonus round. If a tie occurred, a final question was asked. A team who buzzed-in and answered correctly advanced to the bonus round. If a team answered incorrectly, the other team automatically won the game.\n\nShop 'til You Drop Round\nThe bonus round involved a shopping spree in which the team tried to accumulate a prize package of at least $2,500 within 90 seconds. One of the team members was the shopper while the other team member was the runner.\n\nThe shopper stood in front of a table with six boxes, each concealing a prize. When the round began, the shopper opened the first box and decided whether or not to keep the prize.

Play continued until six items were kept/exchanged, or until time ran out. At least one of the stores in the mall contained a prize worth at least $700.\n\nOnce the first half of the round was completed, the retail values of the prizes on the table were added one-by-one.

In group theory, a direct sum is a way to combine two or more subgroups to form a larger group. To create a direct sum, the subgroups involved must be normal and have only the identity element in common. Also, the larger group is generated by these subgroups.\n\nRegarding properties, when a group g is the direct sum of subgroups h and k, two main properties hold:\n1. The product of an element from h and an element from k equals the product of the element from k and the element from h.\n2. Every element in g has a unique representation as the product of elements from h and k. \n\n<user> Thanks! that makes sense. how about the concept of direct summand? what does it mean for a subgroup to be a direct summand of a group? \n\n<assistant> Great question! In group theory, a subgroup h is called a direct summand of a group g if there exists another subgroup k in g such that g is the direct sum of h and k. This means that h and k are both normal subgroups of g, with trivial intersection, and together they generate g.\n\nFor abelian groups (groups where the order of elements' multiplication doesn't matter), there's a special case: if h is a divisible subgroup of an abelian group g, then h is a direct summand of g. In other words, there exists another subgroup k such that g is the direct sum of h and k.\n\nAn example can be found in vector spaces: if g also has a vector space structure, you can write g as a direct sum of h and another subspace l, which will be isomorphic to the quotient g/h. \n\n<user> What is the difference between a direct sum and a direct product in group theory? \n\n<assistant> Both direct sum and direct product are ways to combine groups, but they have slightly different properties.\n\nIn a direct product, you form a new group by taking an element from each of the original groups and combining them into ordered pairs. The elements are combined component-wise, so if you have two groups a and b with elements a₁, a₂ from a and b₁, b₂ from b, the product (a₁, b₁)(a₂, b₂) in the direct product group a × b will be (a₁a₂, b₁b₂). The direct product typically results in a larger group than the original ones, with an order (number of elements) equal to the product of the orders of the original groups.\n\nDirect sum, on the other hand, combines two or more groups by adding the elements from each group. The resulting group is generated by the original groups, and they must be normal subgroups with trivial intersection (i.e., only sharing the identity element) to form a direct sum. In this context, the process is slightly more restrictive than direct product since it requires normality and trivial intersection.\n\nHowever, for finite sets of subgroups, the direct sum is isomorphic (structurally similar) to the direct product, because multiplication of elements in a direct sum is isomorphic to multiplication of the corresponding elements in the direct product. So, for finite sets of subgroups, σhi (direct sum) is isomorphic to ×{hi} (direct product).\n\nIn summary, while both concepts involve combining groups, the direct sum has more stringent conditions, and the resulting groups may have different algebraic properties. \n\n<user> Interesting! can you please provide an example of a finite group decomposed into direct sums of indecomposable subgroups? also, how does the remak-krull-schmidt theorem relate to this decomposition? \n\n<assistant> Sure! Let's consider the Klein four-group V, which has the following elements: {e, a, b, c} where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c are distinct elements satisfying a² = b² = c² = e. The Klein four-group can be expressed as the direct sum of its cyclic subgroups generated by a and b: V = <a> ⨁ <b>.\n\nIn this case, the subgroups <a> and <b> are both indecomposable because they cannot be expressed as direct sums of any other non-trivial subgroups.\n\nNow, let's address the Remak-Krull-Schmidt theorem. This theorem comes into play when a finite group G is decomposed into direct sums of indecomposable subgroups in two different ways, say G = ΣAi and G = ΣBj, where each Ai and each Bj is non-trivial and indecomposable. The Remak-Krull-Schmidt theorem states that even though these decompositions may appear different, they have equal terms up to reordering and isomorphism.\n\nSo, if we find two decompositions of G into direct sums of indecomposable subgroups, the terms of these decompositions will be essentially the same, just possibly in a different order or isomorphic to one another. This theorem assures us that any decomposition of a finite group into direct sums of indecomposable subgroups has a unique structure. ",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you give me a summary of voltaire's candide? \n\n<assistant> Candide, or optimism, is a french satire written by voltaire, a philosopher of the age of enlightenment. First published in 1759, the story follows a young man named candide, who is living a sheltered life in an edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with leibnizian optimism by his mentor, professor pangloss. The novella begins with the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, and candide then endures a series of hardships, slowly leading to his disillusionment with the optimistic philosophy.\n\nCandide is known for its sarcastic tone, fantastical and fast-moving plot, and allegorical critique of religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers. Voltaire particularly targets leibniz and his optimism, highlighting the flaws of believing that \"all is for the best\" in the \"best of all possible worlds.\"\n\nThe story is influenced by historical events such as the seven years' war and the 1755 lisbon earthquake, which challenged the optimistic worldview held by many philosophers at the time. Candide ultimately advocates a deeply practical precept, \"we must cultivate our garden,\" as an alternative to the mantra of optimism. Today, candide is considered voltaire's magnum opus and is frequently taught in literature classes. \n\n<user> How did the 1755 lisbon earthquake influence candide? \n\n<assistant> The 1755 lisbon earthquake, which occurred on all saints' day, was a catastrophic event that shook the foundations of contemporary theology and philosophy, particularly the optimistic doctrine of the time. This optimism, based on the theodicy of gottfried wilhelm leibniz, posited that everything happens for the best in this world because god is benevolent. This belief can be summarized as \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.\"\n\nThe earthquake, along with the resulting tsunami and fires, caused massive destruction and loss of life. This catastrophe presented a challenge for philosophers who tried to reconcile such a devastating event with the optimistic worldview. Voltaire, who was already disillusioned with such idealist doctrines, used the earthquake as an opportunity to satirize and criticize optimism in candide.\n\nIn both candide and his \"poem on the lisbon disaster,\" voltaire disputes the notion of an optimist world by incorporating elements from the lisbon earthquake. He employs sarcasm to ridicule the idea that the earthquake could be considered a part of the \"best possible world,\" highlighting the absurdity of the optimist perspective when confronted with real-world suffering and catastrophe.\n\nVoltaire also drew on contemporary sources like ange goudar's \"relation historique du tremblement de terre survenu à lisbonne\" for information on the earthquake, using facts and details to emphasize the magnitude of the disaster and the urgency of reevaluating optimistic philosophy in light of such events. \n\n<user> How does the satirical tone of candide impact readers' view of the story? \n\n<assistant> The satirical tone of candide is an essential aspect of the novella, as it delivers a powerful critique of the various targets of voltaire's criticism—religious orthodoxy, governments, philosophies, and, most notably, leibnizian optimism. By employing satire, voltaire is able to accentuate the absurdity of certain ideas and beliefs, ultimately inviting readers to reconsider their own viewpoints.\n\nThrough the humor and wit of satire, voltaire engages readers by depicting serious issues in a more accessible manner. As readers follow the fantastical and fast-moving plot, they are confronted with various absurd situations that reveal the inherent contradictions, hypocrisy, or illogic of the various targets of his satire. This enables readers to discern issues that might not have been as apparent in a more straightforward narrative.\n\nA prime example of this satirical tone is the portrayal of pangloss, candide's mentor, who embodies the extremist version of optimism. Pangloss insists, against all visible evidence, that everything happens for the best, even when confronted by extreme suffering and hardship. His dogmatic adherence to optimism is portrayed in a comical and absurd way, ultimately highlighting the flaws of the overly idealistic philosophy and the problems caused by blind faith in such a system.\n\nAdditionally, voltaire utilizes caricatures, exaggerations, and even elements of farce throughout the story, which create a lighter and more entertaining atmosphere despite the grave subject matter, making it more digestible for a wider audience. However, this does not imply that the work aims simply to amuse; rather, the humor, combined with voltaire's keen insights into human nature and society, serve as a vehicle for the deeper message, which calls for a more practical, grounded approach to living in the world.\n\nBy utilizing satire, voltaire encourages readers to think critically about the philosophical systems and societal institutions they encounter, and to look beyond dogmas and assumptions in favor of reason, practicality, and compassion. In doing so, candide not only entertains but also educates, ultimately promoting the enlightenment values of rationality, skepticism, and the pursuit of truth as a means of improving the human condition. \n\n<user> How has candide influenced later authors and artists? \n\n<assistant> Candide has had a lasting impact on subsequent authors and artists, who have been inspired by its sharp wit, insightful portrayal of the human condition, and its bold critique of prevailing societal norms and philosophical doctrines. The innovative use of satire, combined with the fantastical plot and memorable characters, has influenced countless works of fiction, as well as adaptations in various art forms.\n\nAuthors such as jonathan swift, who also employed satire in works like gulliver's travels, are seen as precursors to candide. In turn, candide has inspired later authors in the tradition of satirical literature, urging them to address serious social and political issues through humor and wit. The novella has also been a foundation for picaresque and bildungsroman genres, with authors using it as a blueprint for crafting their own stories of the protagonist's mishaps and journey towards enlightenment and self-discovery.\n\nCandide's influence extends beyond literature, as it has been adapted into numerous operas, plays, and ballets, an example being leonard bernstein's operetta \"candide.\" furthermore, the novella's central themes and ideas have resonated through various art forms, with creators drawing inspiration from voltaire's critique of blind optimism and the need for practical engagement with the world around us. In this way, candide's legacy continues to thrive in both literature and the broader realm of arts and culture. ",

        "reference": " = Candide = \n\n Candide , ou l 'Optimisme ( / ˌkænˈdiːd / \n French : [ kɑ ̃ did ] ) is a French satire first published in 1759 by Voltaire , a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment \n The novella has been widely translated , with English versions titled Candide : or , All for the Best ( 1759 ) \n Candide : or , The Optimist ( 1762 ) \n and Candide : or , Optimism ( 1947 ) \n It begins with a young man , Candide , who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism ( or simply \" optimism \" ) by his mentor , Professor Pangloss \n The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle , followed by Candide 's slow , painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world \n Voltaire concludes with Candide , if not rejecting optimism outright , advocating a deeply practical precept , \" we must cultivate our garden \" , in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss , \" all is for the best \" in the \" best of all possible worlds \" \n \n\n Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone as well as by its erratic , fantastical and fast-moving plot \n A picaresque novel with a story similar to that of a more serious Bildungsroman , it parodies many adventure and romance clichés , the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact \n Still , the events discussed are often based on historical happenings , such as the Seven Years ' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake \n As philosophers of Voltaire 's day contended with the problem of evil , so too does Candide in this short novel , albeit more directly and humorously \n Voltaire ridicules religion , theologians , governments , armies , philosophies , and philosophers through allegory \n most conspicuously , he assaults Leibniz and his optimism \n \n\n As expected by Voltaire , Candide has enjoyed both great success and great scandal \n Immediately after its secretive publication , the book was widely banned because it contained religious blasphemy , political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of naïveté \n However , with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition , the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it \n Today , Candide is recognized as Voltaire 's magnum opus and is often listed as part of the Western canon \n it is among the most frequently taught works of French literature \n The British poet and literary critic Martin Seymour-Smith listed Candide as one of the 100 most influential books ever written \n \n\n = = Historical and literary background = = \n\n A number of historical events inspired Voltaire to write Candide , most notably the publication of Leibniz 's \" Monadology \" , a short metaphysical treatise , the Seven Years ' War , and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake \n Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in Candide and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition \n The 1755 Lisbon earthquake , tsunami , and resulting fires of All Saints ' Day , had a strong influence on theologians of the day and on Voltaire , who was himself disillusioned by them \n The earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism , a philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur \n Optimism is founded on the theodicy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz that says all is for the best because God is a benevolent deity \n This concept is often put into the form , \" all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds \" ( Fr \n Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles ) \n Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into the optimist world view \n \n\n Voltaire actively rejected Leibnizian optimism after the natural disaster , convinced that if this were the best possible world , it should surely be better than it is \n In both Candide and Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ( \" Poem on the Lisbon Disaster \" ) , Voltaire attacks this optimist belief \n He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both Candide and his Poème to argue this point , sarcastically describing the catastrophe as one of the most horrible disasters \" in the best of all possible worlds \" \n Immediately after the earthquake , unreliable rumours circulated around Europe , sometimes overestimating the severity of the event \n Ira Wade , a noted expert on Voltaire and Candide , has analysed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event \n Wade speculates that Voltaire 's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu à Lisbonne by Ange Goudar \n \n\n Apart from such events , contemporaneous stereotypes of the German personality may have been a source of inspiration for the text , as they were for Simplicius Simplicissimus , a 1669 satirical picaresque novel written by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen and inspired by the Thirty Years ' War \n The protagonist of this novel , who was supposed to embody stereotypically German characteristics , is quite similar to the protagonist of Candide \n These stereotypes , according to Voltaire biographer Alfred Owen Aldridge , include \" extreme credulousness or sentimental simplicity \" , two of Candide 's , and Simplicius 's , defining qualities \n Aldridge writes , \" Since Voltaire admitted familiarity with fifteenth-century German authors who used a bold and buffoonish style , it is quite possible that he knew Simplicissimus as well \n \" \n\n A satirical and parodic precursor of Candide , Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels ( 1726 ) is one of Candide 's closest literary relatives \n",

What can you tell me about it and its history? \n\n<assistant> The cortez motor home was a class-a motor coach that was produced in the united states between the years 1963 and 1979. It was a unique and innovative vehicle for its time, combining comfort and functionality in a stylish design that appealed to many customers.\n\nThe first cortez motor home was manufactured by the clark equipment company, a company better known for their forklifts and heavy machinery. The original model, known as the clark cortez, remained in production from 1963 to 1968. Afterward, in 1971, the manufacturing rights were sold to the kent corporation which continued production until 1979. Along with the change in ownership came a change in the name, from clark cortez to kent cortez.\n\nThe cortez motor home offered several features that made it stand out from other motorhomes of the time.

In the final sanctions imposed against the class: 24 students were suspended from three months to twenty-four months, and an additional 18 students received letters of reprimand.\n\nNotable alumni \nGary Dilley, American Olympic medalist in swimming, orthodontist\nSidney Clayton Goff, member of the Wisconsin State Assembly\nSteve Green, former NBA player\nDaniel Laskin, oral and maxillofacial surgeon and educator\nRobert M.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Gonzales v. o centro espírita beneficente união do vegetal case and its significance? \n\n<assistant> Gonzales v. O centro espírita beneficente união do vegetal (udv) was a 2006 united states supreme court case that centered around religious freedom and the government's ability to regulate the use of controlled substances. The case involved the seizure of hoasca (ayahuasca) tea by u.s. Customs agents in 1999, which was shipped to the new mexico branch of udv, a church originating in brazil that uses the tea in its religious ceremonies. Ayahuasca contains dimethyltryptamine, a schedule i controlled substance. No charges were filed, but the u.s. Chapter of udv, led by jeffrey bronfman, filed a suit claiming that the seizure violated church members' rights.\n\nUdv argued that their usage of hoasca was permitted under the 1993 religious freedom restoration act (rfra), which protects religious practices from government interference unless the government can show a compelling interest in doing so. The church won a preliminary injunction from the united states district court for the district of new mexico, which was affirmed on appeal.\n\nThe supreme court ultimately sided with udv in a unanimous decision, finding that the government failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in barring religious usage of hoasca under the rfra. The court also rejected the government's argument that the uniform application of the controlled substances act (csa) does not allow for exceptions.\n\nThis case is significant because it reinforced the role of the rfra in protecting religious practices involving controlled substances and highlighted the burden on the government to demonstrate a compelling interest when interfering with such practices. \n\n<user> How did the supreme court reach its conclusion in this case? \n\n<assistant> In arriving at its decision, the supreme court assessed the government's claims and applied the strict scrutiny standard as required by the religious freedom restoration act (rfra) when reviewing potential infringements on religious practices.\n\nFirst, the court ruled that the standard for granting a preliminary injunction under rfra is the same as at trial. The court also determined that ayahuasca is covered under the 1971 united nations convention on psychotropic substances, which is implemented by the controlled substances act (csa). They rejected the district court's previous interpretation of the treaty.\n\nHowever, the government had not submitted any evidence regarding the international consequences of granting an exemption to udv's use of hoasca. Due to this lack of evidence, the court ruled that the government failed to meet its burden on this point. Furthermore, the supreme court found that the government could not demonstrate a compelling interest in applying the csa to udv's sacramental use of hoasca.\n\nBy analyzing these key points, the supreme court ruled in favor of udv, thus reinforcing the protection granted by the rfra for religious practices involving controlled substances and emphasizing the burden on the government to justify its interference. \n\n<user> What was the background of the case? how did the case progress through the lower courts before reaching the supreme court? \n\n<assistant> The background of the gonzales v. O centro espírita beneficente união do vegetal case began on may 21, 1999, when u.s. Customs agents seized over 30 gallons of hoasca tea shipped to the santa fe, new mexico branch of udv. No charges were filed, but the u.s. Chapter, led by jeffrey bronfman, filed a suit claiming that the seizure violated church members' rights, and argued that their usage was permitted under the 1993 religious freedom restoration act (rfra).\n\nUdv sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the federal government from barring their usage of hoasca. In august 2002, u.s. District chief judge james aubrey parker granted the church's motion, finding it was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim under rfra.\n\nThe case then reached the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit, and in september 2003, senior judge john carbone porfilio, joined by judge stephanie kulp seymour, affirmed the decision. There was dissent from judge michael r. Murphy. In november 2004, a divided majority of the en banc 10th circuit affirmed in a per curiam decision, with a vote of 8-5.\n\nWhile the case was progressing through the appellate courts, the supreme court lifted a stay in december 2004, allowing the church to use hoasca for their christmas services. Oral arguments were heard on november 1, 2005, with edwin kneedler, the deputy solicitor general of the united states, representing the government. The case reached its conclusion on february 21, 2006, when the supreme court unanimously decided in favor of the church. \n\n<user> Could you provide more information about the religious freedom restoration act and its role in this case? \n\n<assistant> The religious freedom restoration act (rfra) was enacted in 1993 in direct response to the supreme court's decision in employment division v. Smith (1990). In that case, the court held that unemployment benefits could be denied to two native americans fired for using peyote, a hallucinogenic substance, as part of their religious practices. As a result, congress enacted rfra to provide broader protection for religious practices against government interference.\n\nUnder rfra, the government may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless it can demonstrate that the burden (1) serves a compelling governmental interest, and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. This strict scrutiny test offers a higher level of protection for religious freedom than the standard applied by the court in employment division v. Smith.\n\nIn the gonzales v. O centro espírita beneficente união do vegetal case, rfra played a central role. Udv argued that the government's seizure of their sacramental tea and attempts to prohibit its use constituted a substantial burden on their religious practices, which should be protected by rfra. The supreme court agreed and ultimately applied the strict scrutiny standard as required by rfra, finding that the government failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in prohibiting the udv's use of hoasca for religious purposes. This decision reinforced the importance of rfra in protecting religious practices that involve controlled substances, placing a substantial burden on the government to justify any interference. ",

O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that, under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the government had failed to show a compelling interest in prosecuting religious adherents for drinking a sacramental tea containing a Schedule I controlled substance.  After the federal government seized its sacramental tea, the União do Vegetal (UDV), the New Mexican branch of a Brazilian church that imbibes ayahuasca in its services, sued, claiming the seizure was illegal, and sought to ensure future importation of the tea for religious use. The church won a preliminary injunction from the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, which was affirmed on appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed. The Court also disagreed with the government's central argument that the uniform application of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) does not allow for exceptions for the substance in this case, as Native Americans are given exceptions to use peyote, another Schedule I substance.\n\nBackground \nOn May 21, 1999, U. S. Customs agents seized over  of hoasca (ayahuasca) tea which was shipped to the Santa Fe, New Mexico branch of the Brazil-based UDV; ayahuasca contains dimethyltryptamine, which is outlawed for most purposes under the Controlled Substances Act. While no charges were filed, the United States chapter, led by Seagram heir Jeffrey Bronfman, filed suit claiming that the seizure was an illegal violation of the church members' rights. They claimed their usage was permitted under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), , a law passed by Congress in direct response to Employment Division v. Smith (1990), in which the Supreme Court held that unemployment benefits could be denied to two Native Americans fired for using Peyote.\n\nIn filing suit, the UDV sought a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from barring their usage of hoasca.  In August 2002, U.S. District Chief Judge James Aubrey Parker granted the church's motion, finding it was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim under RFRA.\n\nIn September 2003, United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit Senior Judge John Carbone Porfilio, joined by Judge Stephanie Kulp Seymour, affirmed, over the dissent of Judge Michael R. Murphy.  In November 2004, a divided majority of the en banc 10th Circuit again affirmed in a per curiam decision, by a vote of 8-5.  Judge Murphy, joined fully by Judges David M. Ebel, Paul Joseph Kelly Jr., and Terrence L. O'Brien, wrote separately to argue that the district court used the correct standard but should not have granted the preliminary injunction. Judge Seymour, joined by Judges Deanell Reece Tacha, Porfilio, Robert Harlan Henry, Mary Beck Briscoe, and Carlos F. Lucero, wrote separately to argue that the district court used the wrong standard but reached the correct result.  Judge Michael W. McConnell, joined in full by Judge Timothy Tymkovich, argued that the district court used the correct standard to reach the correct result, and partially joined those parts of the other opinions that said so.\n\nAs it worked its way through the appellate courts, the Supreme Court lifted a stay in December 2004 thereby permitting the church to use hoasca for their Christmas services.  One-hour of oral arguments were heard on November 1, 2005, where Edwin Kneedler, the Deputy Solicitor General of the United States, appeared for the government.\n\nOpinion of the Court \nOn February 21, 2006, the Supreme Court unanimously delivered judgment in favor of the church, affirming and remanding to the lower court.  Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court of eight justices. Justice Samuel Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of the case because he was not on the Court when the case was argued. The Court found that the government was unable to detail the government's compelling interest in barring religious usage of Hoasca when applying strict scrutiny as required by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n\nThe Court first found that the standard under RFRA for a preliminary injunction is the same as at trial, just as it would be for a constitutional claim.  Disagreeing with the District Court, the Supreme Court found that ayahuasca is covered under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, which is implemented by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The Court rejected the District Court's reliance on the official commentary to the convention, reasoning that the United Nations had incorrectly interpreted the treaty when it found that tea made from plants is a naturally occurring material.  However, because the government had failed to submit any evidence on the international consequences of granting an exemption to CSA enforcement by allowing UDV to practice its religion, the Court ruled that it had failed to meet its burden on this point. The Supreme Court ruled that the government failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV's sacramental use of the tea.",

Maurice had reformed the dutch army, introducing new concepts of drill, standard commands, and combining them with standardization and thorough bookkeeping. This resulted in a dependable, predictable, and steadfast army with high continuous firepower, deadly cavalry, and experienced officers.\n\nOn the other hand, albert had little military experience. The spanish army was as experienced as the dutch, but several of its highest-ranking officers lacked experience. The spanish army was also facing problems such as financial constraints, delayed wages, and widespread mutiny, which made it more challenging for albert to properly manage his troops. \n\n<user> Can you describe the plan maurice followed to capture dunkirk, goals associated with it, and its importance in the overall strategy? \n\n<assistant> Maurice's plan to capture Dunkirk was ambitious and driven by strategic goals. The Dutch government wanted to capture the Spaniards' main port in the north to reduce the damage inflicted on Dutch merchants and fishermen, as well as to lower the costs associated with maintaining a permanent blockade. Capturing Dunkirk would also provide the Dutch with a bargaining chip when dealing with France and England.\n\nMaurice intended to use Ostend, a Dutch-held territory to the north, as a base of operation. Two obstacles lay between Ostend and his main target, Dunkirk: Fort Albert, south of Ostend, and the port city of Nieuwpoort. The plan was to land an army right in front of Nieuwpoort, capture the city and the fort, and then march towards Dunkirk.\n\nIt was important to act quickly, as Ostend was being gradually encircled by forts, and it was only a matter of time before Albert would lay siege to it. However, Maurice and the military initially disagreed on the target, with the military preferring Sluis, another Spanish stronghold. The Dutch government ultimately overruled them, deciding to focus on Dunkirk. \n\n<user> Tactical approach and logistical preparations that maurice conducted for his campaign against the spanish, the composition of his army, and how these factors played a role in their eventual success in the battle of nieuwpoort? \n\n<assistant> To prepare for the campaign against the spanish, maurice collected an army of twelve infantry regiments and 25 troops of cavalry, totaling about 12,000 foot and 2,000 horse by 21 june. He wanted an army with a strong mix of infantry and cavalry units to provide continuous firepower and maneuverability on the battlefield.\n\nMaurice's previous reforms and innovations in the dutch army were key to their tactical approach. The new concepts of drill, standard commands, and standardization, along with thorough bookkeeping, allowed maurice to create an efficient, predictable, and steadfast army that could quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions. This superior organization and discipline played a crucial role in their eventual success in the battle of nieuwpoort.\n\nAdditionally, maurice leveraged the challenges faced by the spanish, such as their financial constraints, unpaid wages, and widespread mutiny. By capturing important border forts, like the new and strong fort crevecoeur, he was able to weaken and demoralize his opponents before the battle even began. \n\n<user> How did maurice's military reforms impact the overall outcome of the eighty years war? \n\n<assistant> Maurice's military reforms had a significant impact on the overall outcome of the eighty years war, as his innovations and leadership greatly improved the dutch army's capability and effectiveness. By introducing new concepts of drill, standard commands, standardization, and thorough bookkeeping, he transformed the dutch army into a disciplined, dependable, and adaptive force that was able to hold its own against the experienced spanish.\n\nThese reforms made it possible for the dutch republic to achieve key victories and maintain pressure on the spanish, preventing them from dominating the netherlands during this long conflict. Maurice's reformed military structure enabled the dutch army to carry out ambitious campaigns, such as the siege of fort crevecoeur and the battle of nieuwpoort.\n\nMaurice's advancements in military tactics and organization also influenced other european powers in the long term, as they began to adopt many of his innovative practices. Ultimately, these reforms contributed to the eventual independence of the dutch republic and had lasting effects on european military strategies beyond the eighty years war. ",

        "reference": "The Battle of Nieuwpoort, was fought on 2 July 1600 during the Eighty Years War and the  Anglo-Spanish war in the dunes near Nieuwpoort. The Anglo-Dutch companies met the Spanish veterans head on which, although their left flank nearly broke, were able to assail them with both infantry and cavalry. The Spanish gradually scattered in all directions and left their guns on the field.\n\nBackground\nThe battle pitted the military leaders of both of the Netherlands (the Dutch Republic and the Habsburg Netherlands) against each other: The armies of the Dutch Republic were commanded by Maurice, Count of Nassau; the armies of the Habsburg Netherlands were commanded by Albert, Duke of Burgundy. Albert ruled autocratically, Maurice had to abide by the demands of the Dutch parliament. Both commanded multinational armies. The Spanish army was 100 percent Catholic, the Dutch army predominantly Protestant.\n\nMaurice (1567-1624) was the son of the leader of the original Dutch rebellion, William of Orange. He had been fighting from an early age. During the past five years, he had set in motion a military revolution by completely reforming the Dutch army, introducing new concepts of drill and standard commands, and combining them with standardization and thorough bookkeeping. This created a dependable, predictable, manoeuvrable and steadfast army, with high continuous firepower, deadly cavalry, and experienced officers high and low.\n\nAlbert (1559-1621) was son and brother of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. His uncle, brother-in-law, and father-in-law was King Philip II of Spain. Albert ruled the Royal Netherlands with his spouse, Philip’s daughter Isabella. He had little military experience. The Spanish army was as experienced as the Dutch, as were its officers, except for several of the highest in command. During Albert's absence in 1598-99, getting married in Spain, the Spanish army had been led by Mendoza, aka the Admiral of Aragon.\n\nAmbition had grown Mendoza’s army to beyond the territory’s financial means. As a result, units had not been paid in a long time. Exacerbated by Albert’s policy to promote bloodline over merit and to break up new regiments to reinforce older, mutiny had become commonplace. Several mutineer ‘republics’ had sprung up along the Dutch border, Diest the biggest. One new regiment even mutinied the moment it arrived from southern Europe and was told it would be broken up, it then camped around Hamont.\n\nTo Dunkirk\nMaurice used these setbacks to capture several important border forts. Chief among those was the brand new and very strong fort Crevecoeur (north of 's-Hertogenbosch, part of previous year's ambitious plans). Its men had mutinied but stayed loyal to the King of Spain. After a two month siege, and despite Spanish relief efforts, it surrendered in May 1600, with full honours intact. Maurice had offered them the pay they were still due by Spain, plus service in the Dutch army, all of which they accepted.\n\nThe relatively easy victory convinced the Dutch government to try something bigger. Dunkirk was the Spaniards main port in the north. It inflicted a lot of damage on Dutch merchants and fishermen. Maintaining a permanent blockade was quite expensive. Capturing it would also give the Dutch a bargaining chip with France and England. It was an ambitious target though and two earlier attempts (1594, 1595) to land an army close by had failed. A safer tactic was to use Dutch-held Ostend to the north as a base of operation. Only two obstacles remained between the two ports: Fort Albert just south of Ostend, and the port city of Nieuwpoort. It was decided to land an army right in front of Nieuwpoort, take it and the fort, and then march to Dunkirk.\n\nThe time was right for an operation deep inside enemy territory. Apart from Spanish mutiny issues, Ostend was being slowly encircled by forts. It was only a matter of time before Albert would lay siege to it: so using Ostend as a base was a matter of now or never. Maurice and the military didn’t agree on Dunkirk however. They’d much rather focus on Sluis, the Spanish galley port north of Ostend. Maurice knew the area well, after landings in 1586, 1591, and two in 1593. Sluis was closer to the Republic and important to control the sea access of major trade centre Antwerp. The government overruled the military however: it was to be Dunkirk.\n\nMaurice's Campaign\n\nFor this operation, by 21 June Maurice had collected an army of twelve infantry regiments and 25 troops of cavalry: some 12,000 Foot and 2,000 Horse.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Movie the go-getter? \n\n<assistant> The go-getter is a 2007 american independent road film directed and written by martin hynes. The movie features a young cast, consisting of lou taylor pucci, zooey deschanel, and jena malone. In the story, 19-year-old mercer, played by pucci, steals a stranger's car to embark on a road trip to find his estranged brother and inform him of their mother's death. Throughout his journey, mercer communicates with the car's owner, kate (deschanel), via her cell phone.\n\nThe film's storyline is partially based on hynes's own experiences. Following his mother's death and the end of his marriage, hynes took a road trip and wrote about various experiences during his travels. Some of these writings eventually came together to form the script for the go-getter. In preparation for production, hynes and three other crew members visited almost every location featured in the film to perform test shoots, trying out different filming styles and techniques. Filming took place from october to november 2005 in oregon, nevada, california, and mexico.\n\nThe soundtrack for the go-getter holds a significant role in setting the tone, with singer and guitarist m. Ward providing most of the music. The film's musical landscape is also enhanced by songs from the black keys, elliott smith, the replacements, and animal collective.\n\nThe go-getter made its debut on january 22, 2007, at the sundance film festival and was given a limited theatrical release on june 6, 2008, by peace arch entertainment. Unfortunately, the film's run lasted only three days, grossing a mere us $11,931. Critical reception was mixed; some critics applauded the performances, dialogue, and cinematography, while others felt the film was unoriginal, forgettable, and suffered from poor acting.\n\nThe plot follows mercer as he journeys to find his estranged half-brother arlen, who is unaware of their mother's passing. Along the way, mercer encounters various characters, discovers the car's owner, kate, and explores various intriguing settings. The film concludes with mercer meeting his brother and reconciling their relationship, and eventually spreading their mother's ashes with kate. \n\n<user> What is the significance of the locations visited in the film? \n\n<assistant> The locations visited in the go-getter are essential in portraying the protagonist mercer's journey of self-discovery and his quest to reconnect with his estranged brother arlen. In traveling through various locations, the film showcases the different people and environments that mercer encounters and explores. The journey highlights the transformative nature of road trips, as mercer's experiences help shape his character development, understanding of himself, and the relationships he forms along the way.\n\nThe go-getter's filming locations include oregon, nevada, california, and mexico. Each location serves to provide unique backdrops and challenges for mercer. For example, in shelter cove, california, mercer visits a bohemian pottery-making commune where arlen once lived. This scene exposes mercer to a different lifestyle and broadens his understanding of his brother's past.\n\nIn reno, nevada, mercer meets up with his childhood crush, the seductive joely (played by jena malone). Their interactions add an element of romance and nostalgia to the story, as well as a sense of maturity as mercer begins to confront his past relationships.\n\nThe film also features the protagonist's trip to sacramento, california, where he finds the pet store where arlen used to work. In these scenes, mercer learns more about his brother's life, deepening his determination to find arlen and bridging their emotional gap.\n\nEnsenada, mexico, is the location where mercer finally meets arlen. This pivotal scene encapsulates the culmination of the entire journey, as mercer confronts his estranged brother and deals with the reality of their fragile relationship.\n\nWriter-director martin hynes's decision to visit nearly every filming location with other crew members before production started demonstrates the importance he placed on the story's setting. By doing so, hynes ensured that the filming style and techniques complemented the various environments, textures, and moods of each location. As a result, the film's treatment of settings contributes significantly to the overall atmosphere, supporting mercer's personal journey and the emotional arc of the go-getter. \n\n<user> Role of the soundtrack in the film? \n\n<assistant> The soundtrack of the go-getter plays a crucial role in enhancing the film's overall mood, atmosphere, and emotional impact. It helps create a distinct character for the movie, immersing the audience in the story and reflecting the characters' emotions and experiences.\n\nSinger and guitarist m. Ward provided most of the music for the film, offering a unique blend of acoustic melodies and contemporary indie-folk tracks. His music adds an intimate, introspective quality to the movie which mirrors mercer's personal journey of self-discovery, growth, and maturation.\n\nIn addition to m.

These artists contribute to the film's diverse range of music styles, intensifying the emotions evoked and underscoring the various phases of mercer's journey. The soundtrack further captures the spirit of a road trip and the sense of adventure, exploration, and transformation that comes with it.\n\nOverall, the role of the soundtrack in the go-getter is essential in constructing the movie's identity, deepening the audience's connection to the characters and their voyage, and reinforcing the film's emotional core. \n\n<user> How was the film received by critics? \n\n<assistant> The go-getter garnered a mixed response from critics. Some critics praised elements such as the performances of the main actors, namely lou taylor pucci, zooey deschanel, and jena malone. Positive reviews also acknowledged the strength of the dialogue and the film's cinematography, which contributed to creating a visually appealing and emotionally engaging experience.\n\nHowever, there were critics who felt the movie was unoriginal and forgettable. Some argued that it did not break new ground in the road film genre and found it somewhat lacking in its portrayal of character development and narrative depth. A few critics also felt the film suffered from poor acting and low-quality delivery from certain cast members.\n\nDespite the divided critical reception, the go-getter remains an indie film that explores the universal themes of loss, family relationships, self-discovery, and the transformative power of travel. Its place in the world of independent cinema allows it to connect with viewers who appreciate its unique approach to storytelling and emotional depth. ",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Hey there, i'm just a curious kid wanting to know more about normative stuff. i overheard my parents talking about it and i'm not really sure what it means. can you explain it in a way that i might understand? i also heard that there are different types of normative stuff, like social or philosophical, what's up with that? they also mentioned normative versus positive claims, which really sounds confusing to me. help me make sense of all this, please! \n\n<assistant> Hello! I'd be happy to explain normative things in a way that's easy to understand. When we talk about something being normative, it means we are discussing what ought to be, what's good or bad, best or worst, or what should be done. It's kind of like a set of rules that help us understand how things should work or how people should behave.\n\nOn the other hand, positive statements are about facts or information, like what actually happened or how things really are. It's about describing things, without making judgments about whether they're good or bad.\n\nNow, let's talk about the different types of normative things you mentioned. First, there's philosophy. In philosophy, normative theories help us make moral judgments about choices or actions. They come from ideas on what is morally good or bad, right, or wrong. This is important for thinking about how we ought to live our lives and treat others.\n\nThen, we have social norms, which are the rules that guide how we behave in society. These rules can be different in each culture and help make sure we get along with each other. It tells us what actions are acceptable or not, and what people might expect from us in different situations.\n\nNormative statements contrast with positive statements, which are about facts and objective descriptions of reality. For example, here's a normative statement: \"children should eat vegetables.\" and here's a positive statement: \"vegetables contain a high proportion of vitamins.\" notice the difference? The first one talks about what children ought to do, and the second one simply tells us a fact about vegetables.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the concept of normative and the different aspects related to it! Feel free to ask if you have any more questions. \n\n<user> Thanks for the explanation! so, i'm wondering about these people called philosophers who discuss normative things. you mentioned aristotle and david hume, but are there others? how do they go about discussing whether you can get an ought from an is, or a value from a fact? it's fascinating that they could have different opinions on this. \n\n<assistant> You're welcome! Yes, there are many philosophers who have discussed normative issues, and they often have different opinions about whether you can get an 'ought' from an 'is'.\n\nSome philosophers, like aristotle, believe that everything in the world has a purpose or goal, and explaining something's purpose tells us what it ought to be. Other philosophers, like david hume, argue that we can't derive moral or ethical judgments (oughts) from objective facts (ises).\n\nThese discussions usually involve careful examination of ethical principles, human values, and how we relate to the world around us. Philosophers use logical reasoning and critical thinking to explore and debate these issues to gain a better understanding of morality and how it applies to our lives.\n\nIt's great to see you're fascinated by these ideas! Don't hesitate to ask if you want to know more. \n\n<user> You've been a great help! now, i'm curious about how normative things help us in daily life. what are some ways they can help us make decisions or organize our thoughts? \n\n<assistant> I'm glad that i could help! Normative ideas and concepts play an essential role in our daily lives by helping us make decisions, set priorities, and organize our thoughts.\n\nWhen we think about what we ought to do, normative concepts help us evaluate our options to determine the best course of action. For example, they can guide us in choosing to be honest with our friends, taking care of our health, or acting responsibly towards the environment.\n\nNormative ideas also help us set personal and societal goals. By understanding what is good, desirable, or valuable, we can decide what we should aim for, both individually and as a society. This can involve setting educational goals, career aspirations, or working towards a more just and fair world.\n\nFurthermore, normative ideas shape our understanding of what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Social norms, for instance, help us navigate different situations by providing a framework for how we ought to interact with others. This can help us avoid conflicts, develop healthy relationships, and contribute positively to our communities.\n\nIn summary, by providing guidance on what is right, wrong, or desirable, normative concepts help us navigate our daily lives more effectively and thoughtfully, allowing us to make better decisions and achieve our individual and collective goals. \n\n<user> Thank you for the comprehensive explanation. as an expert on this subject, can you comment on any recent developments or advancements in the study of normative concepts that might be of interest to those in the field? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The study of normative concepts is an ever-evolving field, with new developments and advancements happening across various disciplines such as philosophy, ethics, and social sciences. One recent trend is the increased focus on understanding normativity in terms of reasons - that is, exploring which factors can offer strong, rational reasons for making moral or ethical decisions.\n\nAnother area of interest is metaethics, where researchers are examining the nature and source of normative concepts, including moral relativism, moral realism, and moral constructivism. These debates explore how we understand moral claims and whether objective moral truths exist.\n\nFinally, there has been growing interest in applying normative concepts to emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. This involves developing ethical frameworks to guide the design, development, and deployment of these technologies, ensuring responsible innovation and alignment with human values.\n\nThese developments showcase the breadth and depth of the study of normative concepts, and their relevance to our ever-changing world.

        "reference": "Normative generally means relating to an evaluative standard. Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good, desirable, or permissible, and others as bad, undesirable, or impermissible. A norm in this normative sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. Normative is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in science, law, and philosophy try to restrict the use of the term normative to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical.\n\nNormative has specialised meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means 'relating to an evaluation or value judgment.' Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.\n\nOne of the major developments in analytic philosophy has seen the reach of normativity spread to virtually all corners of the field, from ethics and the philosophy of action, to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. Saul Kripke famously showed that rules (including mathematical rules, such as the repetition of a decimal pattern) are normative in an important respect.\n\nThough philosophers disagree about how normativity should be understood, it has become increasingly common to understand normative claims as claims about reasons. As Derek Parfit explains:\n\nPhilosophy \n\nIn philosophy, normative theory aims to make moral judgements on events, focusing on  preserving something they deem as morally good, or preventing a change for the worse. The theory has its origins in Greece. Normative statements make claims about how institutions should or ought to be designed, how to value them, which things are good or bad, and which actions are right or wrong. Normative claims are usually contrasted with positive (i.e. descriptive, explanatory, or constative) claims when describing types of theories, beliefs, or propositions. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual, empirical statements that attempt to describe reality.\n\nFor example, \"children should eat vegetables\", and \"those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither\" are normative claims. On the other hand, \"vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins\", and \"a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both\" are positive claims. Whether a statement is normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.\n\nThere are several schools of thought regarding the status of normative statements and whether they can be rationally discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of practical reason extending from Aristotle through Kant to Habermas, which asserts that they can, and the tradition of emotivism, which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content.\n\nThere is large debate in philosophy surrounding the normative and whether you can get a normative statement from an empirical one (ie whether you can get an 'ought' from an 'is', or a 'value' from a 'fact'). Aristotle is one scholar who believed that you could in fact get an ought from an is. He believed that the universe was teleological and that everything in it has a purpose. To explain why something is a certain way, Aristotle believed you could simply say that it is trying to be what it ought to be. On the contrary, David Hume believed you cannot get an ought from an is because no matter how much you think something ought to be a certain way it will not change the way it is. Despite this, Hume used empirical experimental methods whilst looking at the normative. Similar to this was Kames, who also used the study of facts and objective to discover a correct system of morals.  The assumption that 'is' can lead to 'ought' is an important component of the philosophy of Roy Bhaskar.\n\nNormative statements and norms, as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life. They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning. Thought, belief, emotion, and action are the basis of much ethical and political discourse; indeed, normativity is arguably the key feature distinguishing ethical and political discourse from other discourses (such as natural science).",

Bhd., who assumed complete ownership of the website.\n\nEditorial \n\nMalaysian auto journalist Chips Yap was hired as Autoworld.com.my’s editor in year 2000. He remained as editor until 2004, when he left to help start rival website Motor Trader, and was replaced by the aforementioned YS Khong, who still remains as the website’s editor today.\n \nOne such member, simply known as TheGunner, joined the writing team in late 2008, and has been actively contributing content since then. Other content contributors include Chan Eu Jin, drexchan, tedtarg, jimijamison and jaime. Chan Eu Jin is said to be the former president and founder of V-Sixers Club – a reputable owners’ club for the Proton Perdana V6 formed in 2001, while drexchan is co-owner of a business specializing in performance parts and accessories.\n\nControversy \n\nShortly prior to its launch in 2004, pictures of the Proton Gen.2, then known as the Wira Replacement Model (WRM) was leaked into the internet, first appearing in Autoworld.com.my’s photo section, uploaded by a registered user. The incident saw Proton lodge a police report to investigate the leak, resulting in then-editor Chips Yap and some Autoworld staff being summoned to record statements in the Ibu Pejabat Polis Kontinjen Kuala Lumpur .",

John dewey believed that art and aesthetics were deeply connected to our everyday experiences. He thought that there's a continuity between enjoying artworks and everyday activities. Unlike kant and german idealists, who focused more on 'high art' or fine art, dewey emphasized that art's essence lies in the whole experience, not just the physical object. So, his theory gives importance to individual encounters and how art and society influence each other. \n\n<user> How does dewey's idea of the \"live creature\" fit into his aesthetic theory? \n\n<assistant> The \"live creature\" is a key concept in dewey's aesthetic theory. It refers to the person experiencing art or the environment around them. For dewey, the entire art process is about the development of an experience. The interaction between the individual, or the 'live creature,' and their environment forms the basis of his theory.\n\nDewey suggests that our senses receive data from the environment, and our perception of these stimuli is a summation. This biological sensory exchange between the 'live creature' and the environment is crucial to understanding his aesthetic theory, as it emphasizes the direct experience of individuals when encountering art.\n\nIn \"art as experience,\" dewey expands the boundaries of aesthetic philosophy by showing that art is connected to everyday experiences. By focusing on the 'live creature,' he underlines the importance of personal experience in understanding and appreciating art, rather than just concentrating on the artwork as an object. \n\n<user> How does dewey's theory of aesthetics apply to new media and various disciplines beyond art? \n\n<assistant> Dewey's theory of aesthetics, which emphasizes the role of experience in understanding and appreciating art, has been found useful in various disciplines and new media contexts. His idea of connecting art to everyday experiences can be applied to the way we interact with digital platforms, virtual reality, and interactive arts.\n\nFor example, when using social media or engaging with interactive installations, the user experience becomes as critical as the content being presented. In these contexts, dewey's focus on the process and the individual's encounter with the environment becomes highly relevant.\n\nMoreover, his emphasis on experience can also be applied to fields like education, where understanding different perspectives and providing engaging learning experiences is crucial. By considering the connections between art and everyday life, dewey's aesthetics theory encourages interdisciplinary thinking and opens up new ways to approach diverse fields, from technology to psychology. \n\n<user> I'm a bit confused about how dewey views the role of the individual art object within his aesthetic theory, considering that it is more focused on the process of the experience. can you elaborate on his thoughts regarding the individual art object and its significance within his theory? \n\n<assistant> Sure, let me explain it in simpler terms. While dewey's aesthetic theory focuses on the experience and the process as a whole, it doesn't mean that the individual art object loses its importance. In fact, it plays a significant role within the framework of his theory.\n\nFor dewey, the individual art object is the primary site where the experiences happen. It's like a gathering point where the artist and the observer, or the 'live creature,' can connect with each other, their personal thoughts and emotions, as well as the broader culture.\n\nThink of the art object as a meeting place. When people come together around a piece of art, they share their experiences with the artwork, the environment, and each other. In this sense, the individual art object serves as a unifying occasion that brings various experiences together.\n\nSo, rather than disregarding the importance of the art object, dewey's theory highlights the key role it plays in the formation of experiences. By focusing on the process and the experience, dewey's theory allows for a more profound appreciation of the individual art object, as it becomes the center stage where the connections between art, life, and society take place.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion you had about the role of the individual art object in dewey's aesthetic theory!

        "reference": "Art as Experience (1934) is  John Dewey's major writing on aesthetics, originally delivered as the first William James Lecture at Harvard (1932). Dewey's aesthetics have been found useful in a number of disciplines, including new media.\n\nDewey had previously written articles on aesthetics in the 1880s and had further addressed the matter in Democracy and Education (1915). In his major work, Experience and Nature (1925), he laid out the beginnings of a theory of aesthetic experience, and wrote two important essays for Philosophy and Civilization (1931).\n\nOverview \nDewey's theory is an attempt to shift the understandings of what is essential and characteristic about the art process from its physical manifestations in the ‘expressive object’ to the process in its entirety, a process whose fundamental element is no longer the material ‘work of art’ but rather the development of an ‘experience’. Experience is something that personally affects one's life. That is why these theories are so crucial to people's social and educational life.\n\nSuch a change in emphasis does not imply, though, that the individual art object has lost significance; far from it, its primacy is clarified: one recognizes an object as the primary site for the dialectical processes of experience, as the unifying occasion for these experiences. Through the expressive object, the artist and the active observer encounter each other, their material and mental environments, and their culture at large.\n\nThe description of the actual act of experiencing is drawn heavily from the biological/psychological theories Dewey expounded in his development of functional psychology. In Dewey's article on reflex arc psychology, he writes that sensory data and worldly stimulus enter into the individual via the channels of afferent sense organs and that the perception of these stimuli is a 'summation' (quote marks not needed. it was and is a valid conception of a well-researched phenomenon. it was treated generally by James in Principles of Psychology (1890) and specifically there in Chapter 3, under Summation of Stimuli: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/57628/57628-h/57628-h.htm): \n\nThe biological sensory exchange between man, whom Dewey calls 'the Live Creature' in Art as Experience, and the environment, is the basis of his aesthetic theory:\n\n  \nThis quotation is a dramatic expansion of the bounds of aesthetic philosophy, for it demonstrates the connections of art with everyday experience and in doing so reminds people of the highest responsibilities that art and society and the individual have always owed to each other:\n\nTo emphasize what is aesthetic about an experience is not to highlight what is apolitical or impractical or otherwise marginal about that experience; instead, it is to emphasize in what ways that experience, as aesthetic, is a 'manifestation, a record, and celebration of the life of a civilization, a means for promoting its development' and, insofar as that aesthetic experience relates to the kinds of experiences had in general, it is also the 'ultimate judgment upon the quality of a civilization.'\n\nSee his Experience and Nature for an extended discussion of 'Experience' in Dewey's philosophy.\n\nChapters\n\nThe Live Creature\nJohn Dewey offers a new theory of art and the aesthetic experience. Dewey proposes that there is a continuity between the refined experience of works of art and everyday activities and events, and in order to understand the aesthetic one must begin with the events and scenes of daily life. This idea stands in opposition to the aesthetic theories presented by Immanuel Kant and also the proponents of German Idealism, which have historically been shown to favor certain heavily classicized forms of art, known commonly as 'High Art' or Fine Art.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Economic philosophy of georgism and its main principles? \n\n<assistant> Georgism, inspired by the american political economist and journalist henry george, is an economic philosophy which advocates that people should own the value they produce themselves, while the economic value derived from land, including natural resources, should be equally distributed among all members of society. It is based on the belief that land and its resources are common goods, and that access to these resources should not be exclusive or lead to inequality.\n\nA key concept in georgism is the implementation of a single tax on land values, also called land value tax (lvt). This tax would replace other taxes, particularly those on income and capital gains. Proponents of georgism argue that the lvt would promote a more productive and just society by reducing wealth disparities and eliminating land speculation.\n\nBy taxing land value and not the improvements made upon it, georgism encourages efficient land use and discourages unproductive land hoarding. This, in turn, fosters economic growth, improves urban planning, and mitigates some of the negative effects of land speculation. Additionally, georgism contends that public revenue generated through lvt can be used to fund essential services and infrastructure projects, further benefiting society as a whole.\n\nOverall, georgism's main principles focus on promoting economic justice, reducing wealth inequality, and ensuring that everyone has the right to benefit from the value of land and natural resources. \n\n<user> Can you provide more insight into henry george's background and how it might have influenced his beliefs and ideas presented in his works, particularly in \"progress and poverty\"? \n\n<assistant> Henry george was born into a lower-middle-class family in philadelphia as the second of ten children. His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout episcopalian. George's early education took place at the episcopal academy in philadelphia, but he didn't complete his studies. Instead, he chose to have a private tutor and supplemented his education by reading avidly and attending lectures at the franklin institute. His formal education ended at age 14, after which he went to sea and later worked as a typesetter in san francisco.\n\nGeorge's personal experiences and observations during his life played a crucial role in shaping his economic beliefs and ideas. In san francisco, he witnessed the harsh realities of poverty, wealth disparity, and the manipulation of resources by powerful interest groups like railroads and land speculators. These observations, combined with his own struggles and near-starvation, fueled his passion for understanding and addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality.\n\nWhen he wrote \"progress and poverty\" in 1879, george sought to investigate the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty in the midst of economic and technological advancement. The book analyzes the cyclic nature of industrialized economies and explores the use of rent capture, such as land value tax and other anti-monopoly reforms, as potential remedies for social problems. His background, hardships, and experiences provided a solid foundation for his thoughts and contributed to his conviction that economic reform was necessary to achieve a more just and equitable society. \n\n<user> How were henry george's ideas received during his lifetime, and what influence did they have on politicians and reform movements? \n\n<assistant> During his lifetime, henry george's ideas gained significant popularity both in the united states and across other anglophone countries. His most famous work, \"progress and poverty,\" sold millions of copies worldwide and established him as a prominent economic thinker of his time. His writings and speeches garnered the attention of the masses and sparked several reform movements of the progressive era.\n\nGeorge's economic philosophy, georgism, influenced politicians, organizations, and political leaders in the united states and abroad. His ideas on land value taxation and other anti-monopoly reforms were embraced by several political parties, like the united labor party and the jefferson democracy party. In fact, george himself ran for the office of mayor of new york city in 1886 and 1897 as a candidate for these parties, receiving 31% and 4% of the votes, respectively.\n\nAlthough george's ideas did not achieve widespread implementation during his lifetime, they continued to inspire and influence later generations of reformers and politicians who sought to address issues of wealth inequality and economic justice. Henry george's advocacy for land value taxation, free trade, the secret ballot, and public ownership of certain natural monopolies left a lasting impact on economic thought and public policy, fostering discussions and debates on these topics that persist even today.\n\nAfter george's death, his legacy was carried forward by organizations and leaders who were committed to the principles of georgism. It's worth noting that george soule, a mid-20th century labor economist and journalist, referred to henry george as \"the most famous american economic writer\" and highlighted the tremendous global reach of his works. \n\n<user> Apart from \"progress and poverty,\" what other works did henry george write, and what are their main concepts? \n\n<assistant> In addition to \"progress and poverty,\" henry george authored several other works that expanded on his economic philosophy and explored various topics of interest. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n1. \"our land and land policy\" (1871): this book, written prior to \"progress and poverty,\" outlined george's initial thoughts on land policy and land value taxation.\n\n2. \"social problems\" (1883): in this work, george delved into various social issues facing the united states during his time, emphasizing the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources to address these challenges.\n\n3. \"protection or free trade\" (1886): this book offered a thorough examination of the debate between protectionism and free trade. George advocated for free trade as a policy that would better serve the interests of society and promote justice and economic growth.\n\n4. \"the condition of labor\" (1891): george responded to pope leo xiii's encyclical \"rerum novarum\" with this open letter, defending his land value tax proposal and further discussing labor and social issues.\n\n5. \"a perplexed philosopher\" (1892): in this book, george critiqued the economic theories of herbert spencer, a prominent philosopher and sociologist of the 19th century. He aimed to highlight inconsistencies within spencer's ideas and defend the principles of georgism.\n\n6. \"the science of political economy\" (1898): published posthumously, this work was george's attempt to provide a comprehensive and systematic treatise on political economy, encapsulating his life's work and economic thought.\n\nThese works reflect george's commitment to addressing social and economic issues, as well as his dedication to spreading the principles of georgism throughout multiple areas of public policy and debate. His persistent advocacy for land value taxation, free trade, and social reforms earned him recognition as a key figure in the history of economic thought. ",

After his death during the second campaign, his ideas were carried forward by organizations and political leaders through the United States and other Anglophone countries. The mid-20th century labor economist and journalist George Soule wrote that George was by far \"the most famous American economic writer\" and \"author of a book which probably had a larger world-wide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nGeorge was born in Philadelphia to a lower-middle-class family, the second of ten children of Richard S. H. George and Catharine Pratt George (née Vallance). His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout Episcopalian, and he sent George to the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia. George chafed at his religious upbringing and left the academy without graduating. Instead he convinced his father to hire a tutor and supplemented this with avid reading and attending lectures at the Franklin Institute. His formal education ended at age 14, and he went to sea as a foremast boy at age 15 in April 1855 on the Hindoo, bound for Melbourne and Calcutta. He ended up in the American West in 1858 and briefly considered prospecting for gold but instead started work the same year in San Francisco as a type setter.\n\nIn California, George fell in love with Annie Corsina Fox from Sydney, Australia. They met on her seventeenth birthday on October 12, 1860. She had been orphaned and was living with an uncle. The uncle, a prosperous, strong-minded man, was opposed to his niece's impoverished suitor. But the couple, defying him, eloped and married on December 3, 1861, with Henry dressed in a borrowed suit and Annie bringing only a packet of books.\n\nThe marriage was a happy one, and four children were born to them. On November 3, 1862 Annie gave birth to future United States Representative from New York, Henry George Jr. (1862–1916). Early on, even with the birth of future sculptor Richard F. George (1865–1912), the family was near starvation. George's other two children were both daughters. The first was Jennie George, (c. 1867–1897), later to become Jennie George Atkinson. George's other daughter was Anna Angela George (1878-1947), who would become mother of both future dancer and choreographer, Agnes de Mille and future actress Peggy George, who was born Margaret George de Mille.\n\nFollowing the birth of his second child George had no work and no money and had to beg for food. As he approached the first well-dressed stranger he saw in the street, George, normally a lawful man, decided to rob him if he was unwilling to help. Fortunately, the man took pity on him and gave him five dollars.\n\nGeorge was raised as an Episcopalian, but he believed in \"deistic humanitarianism\". His wife Annie was Irish Catholic, but Henry George Jr. wrote that the children were mainly influenced by Henry George's deism and humanism.\n\nCareer in journalism \n\nAfter deciding against gold mining in British Columbia, George was hired as a printer for the newly created San Francisco Times. He was able to immediately submit editorials for publication, including the popular What the Railroads Will Bring Us, which remained required reading in California schools for decades.  George climbed the ranks of the Times, eventually becoming managing editor in the summer of 1867.  George worked for several papers, including four years (1871–1875) as editor of his own newspaper, the San Francisco Daily Evening Post, and for a time running the Reporter, a Democratic anti-monopoly publication.  George experienced four tough years of trying to keep his newspaper afloat and was eventually forced to go to the streets to beg. The George family struggled, but George's improving reputation and involvement in the newspaper industry lifted them from poverty.\n\nPolitical and economic philosophy\nGeorge began as a Lincoln Republican, but then became a Democrat. He was a strong critic of railroad and mining interests, corrupt politicians, land speculators, and labor contractors. He first articulated his views in an 1868 article entitled \"What the Railroad Will Bring Us.\" George argued that the boom in railroad construction would benefit only the lucky few who owned interests in the railroads and other related enterprises, while throwing the greater part of the population into abject poverty. This had led to him earning the enmity of the Central Pacific Railroad's executives, who helped defeat his bid for election to the California State Assembly.\n\nOne day in 1871 George went for a horseback ride and stopped to rest while overlooking San Francisco Bay. He later wrote of the revelation that he had:\n\nFurthermore, on a visit to New York City, he was struck by the apparent paradox that the poor in that long-established city were much worse off than the poor in less developed California. These observations supplied the theme and title for his 1879 book Progress and Poverty, which was a great success, selling over three million copies.",

It is one of three deer species native to the country, the others being the philippine sambar (rusa marianna) and the visayan spotted deer (rusa alfredi).\n\nThe calamian deer is called \"hog deer\" because of its unique behavior when fleeing from danger. Instead of jumping over barriers like other deer, it dashes through underbrush with its head down, similar to a hog. These animals are crepuscular, meaning they are active at sunrise and twilight. They rest during the warmer part of the day and emerge from the undergrowth to forage. Calamian deer are mainly solitary but can form small herds if undisturbed. As ruminants, they have four stomach chambers and chew cud. Their diet consists of shoots, twigs, and leaves, and their primary vocalization is a soft, high-pitched nasal call.\n\nIn terms of conservation, the calamian deer is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss, hunting, and a limited distribution range. Conservation efforts are essential to protect the species and preserve its unique ecosystem. The iucn and other organizations classify the calamian deer in the genus axis, which is consistent with the recent conclusions of the american society of mammalogists. \n\n<user> That's pretty interesting! so where do these calamian deer live exactly and what kind of environment do they prefer? and are there any predators they have to watch out for? \n\n<assistant> The Calamian deer (Axis calamianensis) is endemic to the Calamian Islands of Palawan province in the Philippines. This group of islands includes Busuanga, Culion, and several smaller islands. During the Pleistocene epoch, these islands were part of the landmass of Greater Palawan, which explains their restricted distribution today.\n\nThe preferred habitat of the Calamian deer includes forest edges and open grassland areas. They thrive in environments with sufficient cover, such as underbrush, which allows them to hide and rest during the warmer parts of the day. This adaptation also plays a role in their unique fleeing behavior, as it helps them avoid predators by quickly moving through the vegetation.\n\nAs for natural predators, there are few that prey on the Calamian deer. Birds of prey and pythons are some of the potential predators, but human activities such as hunting and habitat destruction pose a more significant threat to the species. Conservation efforts to protect their habitats and population are crucial to ensure the survival of the Calamian deer. \n\n<user> I'm aware that there's been some debate over the classification of the Calamian deer and its relation to other deer species. Can you elaborate upon these taxonomic issues and any recent developments? \n\n<assistant> Taxonomists have had differing opinions on the classification of the calamian deer, mainly in determining the appropriate genus for the species. Some taxonomists placed the calamian deer in the genus hyelaphus, which includes a few other asian deer species. However, there has been a recent development in this area.\n\nIn 2021, based on the latest evidence and research, the american society of mammalogists decided to place the calamian deer in the genus axis, which also contains other deer species like the indian hog deer (a. Porcinus) and bawean deer (a. Kuhlii). The international union for conservation of nature (iucn) also uses the axis genus to classify the calamian deer.\n\nThese taxonomic adjustments help improve our understanding of the relationships among deer species, thus enhancing conservation strategies and ensuring more effective protection of these animals. \n\n<user> What do we know about calamian deer fossils and their historical presence in the region? \n\n<assistant> The study of calamian deer fossils provides valuable insights into their historical presence and distribution in the region. Fossils have been discovered at ille cave near the village of new ibajay in palawan. The findings include remains from tigers, deer, macaques, bearded pigs, small mammals, lizards, snakes, and turtles.\n\nEarly humans are believed to have accumulated these bones, as evidenced by stone tools, cuts on the bones, and the use of fire found alongside the fossils. Researchers have compared cranial and mandibular elements, as well as teeth from the ille cave deer with samples of calamian hog deer, philippine brown deer, and visayan spotted deer, thus identifying two deer taxa: axis and cervus.\n\nDeer skeletons are regularly found in deposits from the terminal pleistocene and early holocene, gradually becoming less common until they vanish in the terminal holocene. The calamian hog deer is considered the most plausible candidate for the smaller taxon identified among these fossils. Interestingly, calamian hog deer now inhabit only the islands of culion and busuanga but not palawan itself, indicating changes in distribution over time. The study of these fossils provides a unique window into the evolutionary history and environmental adaptations of the species. ",

        "reference": "The Calamian deer (Axis calamianensis), also known as Calamian hog deer, is an endangered species of deer found only in the Calamian Islands of Palawan province in the Philippines. It is one of three species of deer native to the Philippines, the other being the Philippine sambar (Rusa marianna) and the Visayan spotted deer (Rusa alfredi).\n\nTaxonomy\nIt is considered by some taxonomists to be in the genus Hyelaphus; however, in 2021, the American Society of Mammalogists placed it in the genus Axis, a position the IUCN also uses.\n\nBehaviour and ecology \nIt is known as the \"hog deer\" because when it is fleeing from danger, it dashes through underbrush with its head down like a hog instead of jumping over barriers like other deer. These animals are crepuscular, meaning that they are active at sunrise and twilight. They rest during the warmer part of the day and then come out from the undergrowth to forage. Mainly solitary, they sometimes form small herds if left undisturbed. As with other deer species, Calamian deer are ruminants, meaning that they have four stomach chambers and chew cud. A soft, high-pitched, nasal call is their main vocalization. Their diet consist of shoots, twigs, and leaves.\n\nCharacteristics \nA typical height for males of  has been reported. Weight can very usually from 79-110 pounds. Males have three-tined antlers. Their fawns are not spotted at birth, which separates them from the best known western population of the Indian hog deer (A. porcinus). There are few natural predators except for birds of prey and pythons.\n\nFossil record \nFossils were found at Ille Cave near the village of New Ibajay in Palawan. They were ascribed to tigers, deer, macaques, bearded pigs, small mammals, lizards, snakes and turtles. From the stone tools, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones.\n\nUsing the work of Von den Driesch, all chosen anatomical features of appendicular elements' anatomical features which were chosen, besides molars, were measured to distinguish between taxa that had close relationships, and see morphometric changes over ages, though not for pigs or deer. For the latter two, cranial and mandibular elements, besides teeth of deer from Ille Cave were compared with samples of the Calamian hog deer, Philippine brown deer, and Visayan spotted deer, and thus two taxa of deer have been identified from the fossils: Axis and Cervus. Throughout deposits of the Terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene and Terminal Pleistocene at Ille Cave, elements of deer skeletons are regular, gradually becoming less before vanishing in the Terminal Holocene. One 'large' and one 'small' taxon can be easily differentiated by the significant change in size observed in the postcranial elements and dentition. From comparisons of the mesial-distal and labio-lingual measurements of individual fossil teeth and mandibular toothrows with those of surviving deer taxa in the Philippines and other Southeast Asian islands, it appears that the Calamian hog deer is most plausible candidate for the small taxon. The hog deer exists in forest edges and open grassland habitats on the islands of Culion and Busuanga, which during the Pleistocene were part of the landmass of Greater Palawan, but not on Palawan itself nowadays.\n\nSee also \n Bawean deer (A. kuhlii)\n\nReferences \n\nAxis\nEndemic fauna of the Philippines\nFauna of the Calamian Islands\nDeer, Calamian\nMammals described in 1888\nTaxa named by Pierre Marie Heude",

The rise of mail volume, as well as the introduction of telegraph in 1850 and a public telephone system in 1887, created a pressing need for a new post office building.\n\nDesign and construction\n\nThe project, created by the Hungarian architects Ernő Foerk and Gyula Sándy in the Hungarian Secession style, envisioned an  long two-story building made of weather-resistant red brick and stone, with three entrances.\n\nThe construction in a  building site in Jurišićeva Street began in 1903, and the new General Post Office started its work on 12 September 1904. The ground floor was dedicated to mail and parcel services, with a telephone booth section, while the first floor housed telegraph and telephone switchboards. The telephone switchboard had a capacity of 1200 subscribers and 2000 connections, and was opened later in the same year.\n\nPre-World War II adaptations\nBy 1925, the preparations for installing a new automatic switchboard for 10,000 subscribers were already underway. In 1926, an additional three-story courtyard wing was completed. The new Siemens-made automatic switchboard became operational in 1928. In 1930, the third story was added to the building, and the original roof turrets were permanently removed in the process.\n\n1941 sabotage\n\nOn 14 September 1941, the telephone switchboard was destroyed in a sabotage organized by Rade Končar of the Communist Party of Croatia as an act of resistance against the Axis-aligned regime of the Independent State of Croatia. The sabotage was executed by three postal employees who managed to smuggle explosives into the strictly guarded building, and plant them in the switchboard during the night shift. After they left the city in the morning, an associate remotely detonated the charges by dialing a preselected phone number. The blast broke all the windows in the building and killed one police agent, injuring several more. The resulting damage caused significant disruption of international telephone service and required an extensive repair.\n\nPost-World War II history\n\nThe building saw its second major adaptation in 1958, in which two side entrances were walled up, leaving only the main entrance from Jurišićeva Street.

The first battle of the marne took place between 6 to 12 september 1914 during the first world war. It was an important battle as it resulted in an allied victory against the german armies in the west, halting the german advance towards paris. The battle was the culmination of the retreat from mons and the pursuit of the french and british armies, which followed the battle of the frontiers in august.\n\nAs german forces approached paris, field marshal sir john french, commander of the british expeditionary force (bef), initially considered a full british retreat to the english channel for evacuation. However, the military governor of paris, joseph simon gallieni, urged for a counter-attack along the marne river to halt germany's advancements. This counter-offensive started on 5 september, led by six french armies and the bef.\n\nBy 9 september, the german 1st and 2nd armies were at risk of encirclement due to the success of the franco-british counteroffensive. Consequently, they were ordered to retreat to the aisne river. The opposing forces pursued the retreating armies, although their pace was slow, and the germans eventually ceased their retreat north of the aisne river, where they fought the first battle of the aisne.\n\nThese events marked the end of germany's initial attempt to swiftly defeat france by invading through belgium in the north and the common border in the south. It also led to the race to the sea, where both sides vied to envelop the northern flank of their opponent, ultimately culminating in the first battle of ypres. \n\n<user> How did the battle of the frontiers and the great retreat lead up to the first battle of the marne? could you expand on the details of these events? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The battle of the frontiers refers to a series of confrontations involving german, french, and belgian armies on the german-french frontier and in southern belgium, which began on 4 august 1914. These operations included the german occupation of liège on 7 august, the french offensive into alsace (the battle of mulhouse), the battle of haelen, the battle of lorraine, and the battle of the ardennes. The battle of the frontiers saw both sides experiencing successes and setbacks as they fought to gain control.\n\nThe great retreat, which took place between 24 august and 5 september 1914, was a strategic withdrawal by the french fifth army and the bef in response to the german advance. The french fifth army retreated from the sambre during the battle of charleroi on 22 august and continued withdrawing south of the sambre on 23 august. Belgian troops also withdrew from namur and dinant, and german forces recaptured mulhouse.\n\nThese events eventually culminated in the first battle of the marne. The german forces' rapid advance towards paris, combined with the franco-british withdrawal in the great retreat, led to the need for a decisive action to halt the german progress. The successful counteroffensive along the marne river by six french armies and the bef pushed back the german forces, eventually leading to the end of germany's initial attempt to swiftly defeat france. This marked the beginning of the race to the sea and the subsequent first battle of ypres. \n\n<user> What happened in the big war with the big armies near the river? \n\n<assistant> In the big war, called world war i, there was an important battle near a river called the marne. The good guys, which were french and british armies, were trying to stop the bad guys, the german army, from taking over france. \n\nThe french and british armies were running away from the germans, but then they decided to be brave and fight back. They had a big battle by the marne river, and they pushed the germans away from paris, the big city they wanted to protect.\n\nAfter the battle, both sides tried to be faster than the other to gain control of more land. This was called the race to the sea. The fighting continued for a long time, and the war had many more big battles. \n\n<user> How did germany's failed plan for a quick victory in france affect the rest of world war i? \n\n<assistant> Germany's failed plan for a quick victory in france, known as the schlieffen plan, significantly impacted the rest of world war i. When the plan failed, it led to a prolonged conflict and established a new type of warfare – trench warfare. This effectively created a stalemate along the western front, where both the allied and central powers were unable to make substantial advances for years.\n\nThe failure of the schlieffen plan also marked the beginning of the race to the sea, as both sides tried to outflank each other, extending their lines of trenches in the process. This eventually led to the development of heavily fortified trench systems, which stretched from the english channel to the swiss frontier.\n\nMoreover, the failure to achieve a rapid victory required both germany and the allies to commit significant resources to the western front. This made it difficult for germany to focus on fighting a multi-front war, as it also faced significant opposition on the eastern front against russia. The prolonged conflict led to immense human, economic, and societal costs for all parties involved, and it set the stage for the geopolitical transformations and lingering tensions that would follow the war's conclusion.

Both sides commenced reciprocal operations to envelop the northern flank of their opponent, in what became known as the Race to the Sea which culminated in the First Battle of Ypres.\n\nBackground\n\nBattle of the Frontiers\n\nThe Battle of the Frontiers is a general name for all the operations of the French armies from  A series of encounter battles began between the German, French and Belgian armies on the German-French frontier and in southern Belgium on 4 August. Liège was occupied by the Germans on 7 August. The first units of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) landed in France and French troops crossed the German frontier. The Battle of Mulhouse (Battle of Alsace ) was the first French offensive of World War I. The French captured Mulhouse, until forced out by a German counter-attack on 11 August, and fell back toward Belfort. On 12 August, the Battle of Haelen was fought by German and Belgian cavalry and infantry, resulting in a Belgian defensive success. The BEF completed its move of four divisions and a cavalry division to France on 16 August, as the last Belgian fort of the Fortified Position of Liège () surrendered. The Belgian government withdrew from Brussels on 18 August.\n\nThe main French offensive, the Battle of Lorraine , began with the Battles of Morhange and Sarrebourg () advances by the First Army on Sarrebourg and the Second Army towards Morhange. Château-Salins near Morhange was captured on 17 August and Sarrebourg the next day. The German 6th and 7th Armies counter-attacked on 20 August, and the Second Army was forced back from Morhange and the First Army was repulsed at Sarrebourg. The German armies crossed the border and advanced on Nancy, but were stopped to the east of the city. The Belgian 4th Division, the solitary part of the Belgian army not to retreat to the defensive lines around Antwerp, dug in to defend Namur, which was besieged on 20 August. Further west, the French Fifth Army had concentrated on the Sambre by 20 August, facing north on either side of Charleroi and east towards Namur and Dinant. Additional support was given to the Belgians at Namur by the French 45th Infantry Brigade. On the left, the Cavalry Corps of General Sordet linked up with the BEF at Mons.\n\nTo the south, the French retook Mulhouse on 19 August and then withdrew. By 20 August, a German counter-offensive in Lorraine had begun and the German 4th and 5th Armies advanced through the Ardennes on 19 August towards Neufchâteau. An offensive by the French Third and Fourth Armies through the Ardennes began on 20 August in support of the French invasion of Lorraine. The opposing armies met in thick fog; the French mistook the German troops for screening forces. On 22 August, the Battle of the Ardennes  began with French attacks, which were costly to both sides and forced the French into a disorderly retreat late on 23 August. The Third Army recoiled towards Verdun, pursued by the 5th Army, and the Fourth Army retreated to Sedan and Stenay. Mulhouse was recaptured again by German forces and the Battle of the Meuse  caused a temporary halt of the German advance.\n\nThe Great Retreat\n\nThe Great Retreat took place from  the French Fifth Army fell back about  from the Sambre during the Battle of Charleroi (22 August) and began a greater withdrawal from the area south of the Sambre on 23 August. That evening, the  troops at Namur withdrew into French-held territory and at Dinant, 674 men, women and children were summarily executed by Saxon troops of the German 3rd Army; the first of several civilian massacres committed by the Germans in 1914.",

He chose central michigan university (cmu) to have the opportunity to start as a linebacker immediately, despite receiving interest from the university of wisconsin and kansas state university. \n\nDuring his college career, bellore started as an inside linebacker from his freshman through senior seasons. He holds the second-highest consecutive start streak at cmu with 51 games. Bellore was named an all-mac first team selection on defense in 2008, 2009, and 2010. He also played in three bowl games and was awarded cmu's defensive player of the year in 2008 and 2009. \n\n<user> When he started his professional career, why did he end up going undrafted in the 2011 nfl draft? \n\n<assistant> Though it's difficult to pinpoint an exact reason why nicholas bellore went undrafted in the 2011 nfl draft, several factors could have contributed. Some players might not be drafted due to concerns about their physical attributes, such as size, speed, or strength. Additionally, they might be perceived as lacking in certain skills or not fitting well into a team's particular scheme or system.

In 1933, he became the first professor of jewish mysticism at the university, working in this capacity until his retirement in 1965, and then becoming an emeritus professor.\n\nScholem's approach to the study of jewish mysticism was groundbreaking and set him apart from the 19th-century wissenschaft des judentums (\"science of judaism\") school, which aimed to submit the study of judaism to the disciplines of history, philology, and philosophy. Scholem believed that this approach failed to recognize the living essence of judaism and overlooked its non-rational aspects.\n\nHis work emphasized that the mythical and mystical elements of judaism were just as important as the rational aspects, and that they made up the religion's true core. He disagreed with personalizing kabbalistic concepts and advocated for an approach that considered the historical context of mysticism.\n\nScholem's major contributions to the field include his collection of lectures, major trends in jewish mysticism (1941), his biography sabbatai zevi, the mystical messiah (1957), and the collected speeches and essays published as on kabbalah and its symbolism (1965). These works helped spread knowledge of jewish mysticism among both jewish and non-jewish audiences. His scholarship had a profound impact on the understanding of jewish mysticism and changed the course of twentieth-century european thought. \n\n<user> Could you explain scholem's friendship with walter benjamin and how it influenced his work? \n\n<assistant> Gershom scholem and walter benjamin first met in munich in 1915, when scholem was 17 years old and benjamin was 23. Their encounter marked the beginning of a lifelong intellectual and personal friendship that lasted until benjamin's suicide in 1940, following persecution by the nazis.\n\nThroughout their relationship, the two friends exchanged ideas and influenced each other's work. Scholem introduced benjamin to jewish mysticism, which later had an impact on benjamin's theoretical writings. They both shared a concern for analyzing historical phenomena in terms of their spiritual and ideological aspects.\n\nScholem dedicated his seminal work, major trends in jewish mysticism, to benjamin. The book was based on his lectures held between 1938 and 1957. This dedication signified the profound effect their friendship had on scholem's academic and personal life, as well as an acknowledgment of benjamin's influence on his understanding of jewish mysticism.\n\nTheir correspondence, along with scholem's correspondence with other notable philosophers such as theodor adorno, hannah arendt, and leo strauss, has been published and provides valuable insights into the intellectual exchanges of the time. \n\n<user> Can you provide an understanding of the three periods in jewish history that scholem believed could be divided, and how they relate to the study of jewish mysticism? \n\n<assistant> Gershom scholem identified three main periods in jewish history, each with its own relationship to mysticism and myth. These periods can be understood as follows:\n\n1. Biblical period: according to scholem, during this period, monotheism struggled against mythology without entirely defeating it. This resulted in the incorporation of certain mythological elements into the foundations of jewish monotheistic thought.\n\n2. Rabbinic period: in this phase, jewish mysticism began to take shape as an independent intellectual, cultural, and religious force within judaism. Scholem asserted that the rational and scholarly approach to studying jewish law and literature (talmud and midrash) was set against a more mystical mindset, which included the study of texts such as the sefer yetzirah and heichalot literature.\n\n3. Medieval and early modern period: in this era, the kabbalistic movement fully emerged, with the development of the zohar, lurianic kabbalah, and various mystical movements like the followers of sabbatai zevi and jacob frank. Scholem studied these movements extensively in his works and emphasized the importance of understanding them as integral parts of jewish history, rather than dismissing them as insignificant or \"irrational.\"\n\nScholem believed that each period contributed to the development of jewish mysticism and that these mystical elements held considerable weight in understanding the course of jewish history. Contrary to the traditional historiographical approach that focused on rational aspects, scholem argued that by studying the mythical and mystical components, one could uncover the living core of judaism and its historical development. \n\n<user> What happened to gershom scholem's brother werner? \n\n<assistant> Werner scholem, gershom's older brother, was a german communist leader. He was part of the ultra-left \"fischer-maslow group\" and became the youngest ever member of the reichstag, or weimar diet, representing the communist party of germany. However, he was expelled from the party due to internal conflicts.\n\nWerner's life took a tragic turn when the nazis came to power in germany. As a prominent communist and a jew, he faced persecution under the third reich. He was arrested by the gestapo, imprisoned, and eventually murdered by the nazis.\n\nIt's important to note that gershom scholem had a vastly different political stance from that of his brother. Gershom was vehemently opposed to both communism and marxism. The differing political perspectives and the tragic fate of werner scholem further highlight the complex historical landscape in which gershom scholem developed his academic ideas and personal beliefs.

        "reference": "Gershom Scholem () (5 December 1897 – 21 February 1982), was a German-born Israeli philosopher and historian. He is widely regarded as the founder of the modern, academic study of Kabbalah. He was  the first professor of Jewish Mysticism at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His close friends included Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Walter Benjamin and Leo Strauss, and selected letters from his correspondence with those philosophers have been published. He was also friendly with the author Shai Agnon and the Talmudic scholar Saul Lieberman.\n\nScholem is best known for his collection of lectures, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (1941) and for his biography Sabbatai Zevi, the Mystical Messiah (1957). His collected speeches and essays, published as On Kabbalah and its Symbolism (1965), helped to spread knowledge of Jewish mysticism among both Jews and non-Jews.\n\nBiography\n\nGerhard (Gershom) Scholem was born in Berlin to Arthur Scholem and Betty Hirsch Scholem. His  father was a printer. His older brother was the German Communist leader Werner Scholem. He studied Hebrew and Talmud with an Orthodox rabbi.\n\nScholem met Walter Benjamin in Munich in 1915, when the former was seventeen years old and the latter was twenty-three. They began a lifelong friendship that ended when Benjamin committed suicide in 1940 in the wake of Nazi persecution. Scholem dedicated his book Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (Die jüdische Mystik in ihren Hauptströmungen), based on lectures 1938–1957, to  Benjamin. In 1915 Scholem enrolled at the Frederick William University in Berlin (today, Humboldt University), where he studied mathematics, philosophy, and Hebrew. There he met Martin Buber, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Hayim Nahman Bialik, Ahad Ha'am, and Zalman Shazar.\n\nIn Berlin, Scholem befriended  Leo Strauss and corresponded with him throughout his life. He studied mathematical logic at the University of Jena under Gottlob Frege. He was in Bern in 1918 with Benjamin when he met Elsa (Escha) Burchhard, who became his first wife. Scholem returned to Germany in 1919, where he received a degree in Semitic languages at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Together with Benjamin he established a fictitious school – the  University of Muri.\n\nScholem wrote his doctoral thesis on the oldest known kabbalistic text, Sefer ha-Bahir. The following year it appeared in book form as \"Das Buch Bahir\", having been published by his father's publishing house.\n\nDrawn to Zionism and influenced by Buber, he immigrated in 1923 to the British Mandate of Palestine. He  became a librarian, heading the Department of Hebrew and Judaica at the National Library. In 1927 he revamped the Dewey Decimal System, making it appropriate for large Judaica collections. Scholem's brother Werner was a member of the ultra-left \"Fischer-Maslow Group\" and the youngest ever member of the Reichstag, or Weimar Diet, representing the Communist Party of Germany. He was expelled from the party and later murdered by the Nazis during the Third Reich. Unlike his brother, Gershom was vehemently opposed to both Communism and Marxism. In 1936, he married his second wife, Fania Freud. Fania, who had been his student and could read Polish, was helpful in his later research, particularly in regard to Jacob Frank.\n\nIn 1946 Scholem was sent by the Hebrew University to search for Jewish books that had been plundered by the Nazis and help return them to their rightful owners. He spent much of the year in Germany and Central Europe as part of this project, known as \"Otzrot HaGolah\".\n\nScholem died in Jerusalem, where he is buried next to his wife in the Sanhedria Cemetery. Jürgen Habermas delivered the eulogy.\n\nAcademic career\nScholem became a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He taught the Kabbalah and mysticism from a scientific point of view and became the first professor of Jewish mysticism at the university in 1933, working in this post until his retirement in 1965, when he became an emeritus professor. \n\nScholem directly contrasted his historiographical approach on the study of Jewish mysticism with the approach of the 19th-century school of the Wissenschaft des Judentums (\"Science of Judaism\"), which sought to submit the study of Judaism to the discipline of subjects such as history, philology, and philosophy. According to Jeremy Adler, Scholem's thinking was \"both recognizably Jewish and deeply German,\" and \"changed the course of twentieth-century European thought.\"\n\nJewish mysticism was seen as Judaism's weakest scholarly link. Scholem told the story of his early research when he was directed to a prominent rabbi who was an expert on Kabbalah. Seeing the rabbi's many books on the subject, Scholem asked about them, only to be told: \"This trash? Why would I waste my time reading nonsense like this?\" (Robinson 2000, p. 396)\n\nThe analysis of Judaism carried out by the Wissenschaft school was flawed in two ways, according to Scholem: It studied Judaism as a dead object rather than as a living organism; and it did not consider the proper foundations of Judaism, the non-rational force that, in Scholem's view, made the religion a living thing.\n\nIn Scholem's opinion, the mythical and mystical components were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the minutiae of Halakha, were the truly living core of Judaism. In particular, he disagreed with what he considered to be Martin Buber's personalization of Kabbalistic concepts as well as what he argued was an inadequate approach to Jewish history, Hebrew language, and the land of Israel.\n\nIn the worldview of Scholem, the research of Jewish mysticism could not be separated from its historical context. Starting from something similar to the Gegengeschichte of  Friedrich Nietzsche, he ended up including less normative aspects of Judaism in the public history.\n\nSpecifically, Scholem thought that Jewish history could be divided into three periods:\n\nDuring the Biblical period, monotheism battles mythology without completely defeating it.",

Positional notation, also known as place-value notation, is a numeral system in which the value of a digit is determined by both the digit itself and its position within the number. This approach allows us to represent larger numbers using fewer symbols and simplifies arithmetic computations when compared to older numeral systems.\n\nOne of the first positional systems was the babylonian numeral system, which had a base of 60. We still see its influence in the way we measure time (60 minutes in an hour) and angles (360 degrees in a circle). Nowadays, the hindu-arabic numeral system (base ten) is the most commonly used globally, likely because it is related to counting with our ten fingers.\n\nBefore positional notation became standard, simpler additive systems like roman numerals were used. Early computing devices like counting rods and abacuses were designed to work with positional numeral systems, making arithmetic operations easier and faster.\n\nOver time, several positional numeral systems were developed across various cultures. The chinese, indian, and arabic civilizations utilized systems that eventually influenced the development of the modern decimal system.\n\nIn addition to integer representations, the implementation of radix points (i.e., decimal points in base ten) allowed for fractions and real numbers to be represented with great accuracy. Mathematicians like abu'l-hasan al-uqlidisi, jamshīd al-kāshī and simon stevin later contributed to the development and adoption of positional decimal fractions.\n\nDid you have any specific questions about the history or evolution of positional notation? \n\n<user> What led to the adoption of the base-10 system globally? \n\n<assistant> The hindu-arabic numeral system, which uses base 10, became the most widespread and commonly used numeral system in the world due to several reasons:\n\n1. Human anatomy: humans have ten fingers, making base-10 intuitive for counting and early arithmetic tasks.\n\n2. Mathematical simplicity: the base-10 system facilitates easy calculations and requires a relatively small set of symbols (0-9) to represent numbers.\n\n3. Historical influence: indian mathematicians played a critical role in developing the decimal system, including the positional notation and the concept of zero. Arab scholars later adopted these principles and transmitted them to the wider world. This transfer of knowledge bolstered the system's influence and facilitated its adoption.\n\n4. European adoption: around the 10th century, european scholars started studying arabic texts and latin translations, carrying the principles of the hindu-arabic numeral system into european mathematics.\n\n5. The printing press: the invention of the printing press in the 15th century helped disseminate mathematical knowledge, including the base-10 system, more rapidly and widely.\n\n6. International trade: as international trade increased, the ease of use and computational advantages of the base-10 system helped it gain dominance over other numeral systems. Merchants and traders adopted the hindu-arabic numeral system because it simplified their work considerably.\n\n7. The french revolution: the french government's promotion of decimal systems, such as decimal currency, decimal time, and the metric system, contributed to the worldwide adoption of base-10 numeral systems. While not all pro-decimal reforms were successful, the decimalization of currency and metric system spread to most parts of the world.\n\nThese factors combined led to the global adoption of the base-10 system, displacing previous numeral systems and making it the standard for modern mathematics and commerce. \n\n<user> Can you make it simple for a kid? \n\n<assistant> Sure! A long time ago, people used different ways to write down numbers. They would use different shapes or symbols for every number, like in roman numerals. But it was hard to do math with these symbols.\n\nThen, some smart people discovered positional notation, which means that the same symbol can mean different things depending on where it is. For example, in the number 555, there are three 5's, but they mean 500, 50, and 5 because of their different positions.\n\nThe main reason we use base-10 (with numbers 0-9) is that we have ten fingers, which makes it easy and natural for us to count. This new way of writing numbers made math easier, and it spread all around the world. Now, we use this system to do all sorts of things, like buying things at the store or measuring how far places are.\n\nSo, positional notation is a way to write and understand numbers that's easy for everyone to use and understand! And that's why we use it today. \n\n<user> I'm curious about the impact of positional notation on the development of ancient and medieval mathematical tools. can you provide some insights on how it influenced those tools and their subsequent advancements? \n\n<assistant> Positional notation had a considerable impact on the development of ancient and medieval mathematical tools. Its simplicity and efficiency meant that computations could be performed much more easily compared to older numeral systems. This led to the creation and evolution of various tools that made use of the positional notation, such as:\n\n1. Counting rods: before the advent of the hindu-arabic numeral system, chinese mathematicians used counting rods to perform arithmetic operations. This positional notation system enabled them to conduct complex calculations and record numbers quickly.\n\n2. Abacus: an abacus is a calculating tool used for arithmetic operations, especially addition and subtraction. Various versions of this tool were used across different cultures, including the roman, chinese, and japanese versions, all of which made use of positional notation. The simplicity of base-10 positional notation made the abacus an efficient tool for merchants, traders, and mathematicians.\n\n3. Indian numerals: indian mathematicians developed a base-10 positional system around the 3rd century bc. Over time, this system evolved and absorbed features like the concept of zero, which allowed for more advanced calculations and greatly helped in the development of algebra.\n\n4. Arabic numerals: the adoption of the hindu-arabic numeral system by arab scholars allowed for the expansion and refinement of mathematical knowledge. Arabic numerals were recorded from the 10th century and allowed for advanced algebraic manipulations and more structured mathematical systems.\n\nThese mathematical tools, influenced by positional notation, played a vital role in the development of mathematical knowledge and techniques during ancient and medieval times. The introduction of positional notation significantly impacted the evolution of these tools, making arithmetic computations more accessible and efficient for everyone, from merchants to scientists.

        "reference": "Positional notation (or place-value notation, or positional numeral system) usually denotes the extension to any base of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system (or decimal system). More generally, a positional system is a numeral system in which the contribution of a digit to the value of a number is the value of the digit multiplied by a factor determined by the position of the digit. In early numeral systems, such as Roman numerals, a digit has only one value: I means one, X means ten and C a hundred (however, the value may be negated if placed before another digit).  In modern positional systems, such as the decimal system, the position of the digit means that its value must be multiplied by some value: in 555, the three identical symbols represent five hundreds, five tens, and five units, respectively, due to their different positions in the digit string.\n\nThe Babylonian numeral system, base 60, was the first positional system to be developed, and its influence is present today in the way time and angles are counted in tallies related to 60, such as 60 minutes in an hour and 360 degrees in a circle. Today, the Hindu–Arabic numeral system (base ten) is the most commonly used system globally. However, the binary numeral system (base two) is used in almost all computers and electronic devices because it is easier to implement efficiently in electronic circuits.\n\nSystems with negative base, complex base or negative digits have been described. Most of them do not require a minus sign for designating negative numbers.\n\nThe use of a radix point (decimal point in base ten), extends to include fractions and allows representing any real number with arbitrary accuracy. With positional notation, arithmetical computations are much simpler than with any older numeral system; this led to the rapid spread of the notation when it was introduced in western Europe.\n\nHistory\n\nToday, the base-10 (decimal) system, which is presumably motivated by counting with the ten fingers, is ubiquitous. Other bases have been used in the past, and some continue to be used today. For example, the Babylonian numeral system, credited as the first positional numeral system, was base-60. However, it lacked a real zero. Initially inferred only from context, later, by about 700 BC, zero came to be indicated by a \"space\" or a \"punctuation symbol\" (such as two slanted wedges) between numerals. It was a placeholder rather than a true zero because it was not used alone or at the end of a number. Numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60) looked the same because the larger number lacked a final placeholder. Only context could differentiate them.\n\nThe polymath Archimedes (ca. 287–212 BC) invented a decimal positional system in his Sand Reckoner which was based on 108 and later led the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss to lament what heights science would have already reached in his days if Archimedes had fully realized the potential of his ingenious discovery.\n\nBefore positional notation became standard, simple additive systems (sign-value notation) such as Roman numerals were used, and accountants in ancient Rome and during the Middle Ages used the abacus or stone counters to do arithmetic.\n\nCounting rods and most abacuses have been used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. With counting rods or abacus to perform arithmetic operations, the writing of the starting, intermediate and final values of a calculation could easily be done with a simple additive system in each position or column. This approach required no memorization of tables (as does positional notation) and could produce practical results quickly. \n\nThe oldest extant positional notation system is that of Chinese rod numerals, used from at least the early 8th century.\nIt isn't clear whether this system was introduced from India or whether it was developed locally.\nIndian numerals originate with the Brahmi numerals of about the 3rd century BC, which symbols were, at the time, not used positionally. \nMedieval Indian numerals are positional, as are the derived Arabic numerals, recorded from the 10th century.\n\nAfter the French Revolution (1789–1799), the new French government promoted the extension of the decimal system.\nSome of those pro-decimal efforts—such as decimal time and the decimal calendar—were unsuccessful.\nOther French pro-decimal efforts—currency decimalisation and the metrication of weights and measures—spread widely out of France to almost the whole world.\n\nHistory of positional fractions \n\nJ. Lennart Berggren notes that positional decimal fractions were used for the first time by Arab mathematician Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi as early as the 10th century. The Jewish mathematician Immanuel Bonfils used decimal fractions around 1350, but did not develop any notation to represent them. The Persian mathematician Jamshīd al-Kāshī made the same discovery of decimal fractions in the 15th century. Al Khwarizmi introduced fractions to Islamic countries in the early 9th century; his fraction presentation was similar to the traditional Chinese mathematical fractions from Sunzi Suanjing. This form of fraction with numerator on top and denominator at bottom without a horizontal bar was also used by 10th century Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi and 15th century Jamshīd al-Kāshī's work \"Arithmetic Key\".\n\nThe adoption of the decimal representation of numbers less than one, a fraction, is often credited to Simon Stevin through his textbook De Thiende; but both Stevin and E. J. Dijksterhuis indicate that Regiomontanus contributed to the European adoption of general decimals:\nEuropean mathematicians, when taking over from the Hindus, via the Arabs, the idea of positional value for integers, neglected to extend this idea to fractions.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Haunting ground and its gameplay elements. \n\n<assistant> Haunting ground is a survival horror video game developed and published by capcom for the playstation 2 in 2005. The game is set in a castle where players control fiona belli, a young girl who wakes up in the dungeon after being involved in a car accident. Throughout the story, with the assistance of a white shepherd named hewie, fiona seeks to escape the castle and unravel its mysteries.\n\nThe gameplay of haunting ground shares many similarities with capcom's earlier survival horror title clock tower 3, and has been considered a spiritual successor to the clock tower series. Players control fiona belli directly and give commands to her canine companion, hewie. Fiona can run, perform a backstep maneuver, and crouch to hide from enemy pursuers. She can also kick and tackle enemies, though tackling reduces stamina. Losing too much stamina will result in fiona's exhaustion, slowing down her movements or making her stop. Exhaustion can be recovered with items or time.\n\nEnvironmental interactions include opening doors, climbing ladders, and checking items. There are hiding spots and retaliation points, which fiona can use to evade pursuers or counterattack enemies, respectively. Hewie, the canine companion, plays an integral role in the gameplay. He won't completely obey fiona at first, and the player will have to build a trusting relationship with him to survive. Hewie can be commanded to sniff out items, attack enemies, or explore the environment. Players can praise or scold hewie to affect his behavior.\n\nEnemies can hear footsteps and other sounds, making stealth crucial for survival. Fiona may fall into panic mode when in danger, during which visibility becomes worse, and her movements become erratic. Damage can be recovered with items or time, but receiving too much damage will result in fiona's death. \n\n<user> How was haunting ground received and what did the critics think? \n\n<assistant> Haunting ground received mixed to average reviews when it was first released in april 2005. Critics praised the graphics and presentation of the game. Additionally, the sexual overtones that presented a disturbing and off-putting atmosphere were also appreciated for adding a unique feel to the game. Hewie, the canine companion, was credited for contributing to this unique feel, as the dog mechanic allowed players to rely on a partner for help and problem-solving.\n\nHowever, despite the graphical and atmospheric elements being well-received, the game's story was criticized for being cliché. Some gameplay aspects were noted as predictable and dated, which had an impact on the overall experience for players.\n\nDespite these criticisms, haunting ground went on to become a cult classic in the survival horror genre, with many players fondly reminiscing about its unique mechanics and atmosphere. The game was re-released digitally in japan for the playstation 3 in 2015, showcasing its enduring appeal and interest.\n\nIt is important to note that while haunting ground didn't necessarily revolutionize the survival horror genre, it still managed to distinguish itself from similar games with its unique gameplay elements involving the partnership with a canine companion and a strong emphasis on hiding, evasion, and using the environment to outsmart enemies. These features have contributed to the game's cult status and the continued appreciation of haunting ground among fans of survival horror. \n\n<user> How did the dog mechanic idea come about during the development of the game? \n\n<assistant> The inclusion of the dog mechanic in haunting ground was a conscious decision made by the developers at capcom during the game's development. The idea behind this move was their belief that retailers and players may not be as receptive to a survival horror title featuring only a lone female protagonist. By adding hewie, the white shepherd companion, the development team hoped to make the game more appealing and engaging to players.\n\nThe dog mechanic turned out to create a unique dynamic in the gameplay, as hewie's role became central to the player's survival. Players have the opportunity to build a trusting relationship with hewie, which further enhances the game experience. His presence aids in exploring the environment, attacking enemies, and solving puzzles, offering vital support to fiona, the protagonist.\n\nAdditionally, the interplay between fiona and hewie adds emotional depth to the game, as their growing bond and reliance on one another contributes to a richer, more immersive story.

In 2004, interbrew and ambev merged to create inbev, the world's largest brewer at that time. This merger combined top brands from belgium, canada, germany, and brazil.\n\nIn 2008, inbev acquired american brewer anheuser-busch for $52 billion, forming anheuser-busch inbev. This expanded inbev's position as the world's largest brewer and created one of the top five consumer products companies. Over the years, ab inbev has continued to grow through various acquisitions, such as harbin brewery (2004), fujian sedrin brewery (2006), and energy drink company hiball (2017). In 2016, ab inbev merged with south african competitor sabmiller, further strengthening its position as the world's largest brewer. \n\n<user> Ab inbev's partnership with a cannabis producer and their affiliation with the international alliance for responsible drinking? \n\n<assistant> In december 2018, ab inbev formed a partnership with cannabis producer tilray, aiming to research cannabis-infused non-alcoholic beverages. They planned to work together on this research through tilray's subsidiary, high park company. This partnership is focused on exploring the potential for non-alcoholic beverages containing thc, cbd, or a combination of both, in response to the growing interest in cannabis-related products.\n\nAnheuser-busch inbev also takes part in responsible consumption initiatives. In 2013, it joined other alcohol producers in signing the international alliance for responsible drinking's producers' commitments. These commitments are a part of an initiative aimed at reducing harmful drinking by promoting responsible consumption practices and cooperating with various stakeholders to address alcohol-related issues. By participating in this initiative, ab inbev demonstrates its commitment to social responsibility and promoting a healthier and safer environment for consumers. \n\n<user> How did ambev become such a big company in latin america and the caribbean? \n\n<assistant> Ambev, or companhia de bebidas das américas, became a major player in the latin america and the caribbean region through a strategic merger and its strong brands. In 1999, the two biggest brazilian brewing companies, antarctica (established in 1880) and brahma (established in 1886), decided to merge, creating ambev. This combination of resources and expertise allowed the new company to have a dominant position in latin america and the caribbean. \n\nAmbev grew and expanded further by focusing on popular beverage brands and establishing a leading presence in the market. Their products appealed to a wide range of consumers, both within brazil and in neighboring countries. Ambev's success eventually led them to merge with interbrew in 2004, forming inbev, the world's largest brewer at that time. This merger amplified their global footprint and further reinforced their presence in the latin american and caribbean markets. \n\n<user> What happened to SABMiller after the merger with AB InBev? \n\n<assistant> After the successful merger with ab inbev in october 2016, sabmiller ceased trading on global stock markets. To avoid potential antitrust issues and regulatory concerns, ab inbev had to divest some of sabmiller's assets.\n\nAs a result, the company sold the former sabmiller's interest in millercoors to molson coors. They also sold many of sabmiller's european brands to the japanese beverage corporation asahi breweries. Furthermore, ab inbev sold a significant portion of sabmiller's coca-cola bottling and distribution interests to the american beverage group, coca-cola company.\n\nThese divestitures not only helped streamline the merged company's operations but also ensured regulatory approval for the merger by addressing concerns about its potential impact on the industry's competitive landscape. In the end, ab inbev became an even larger global brewer with a vast portfolio of beer brands and an increased market share in various regions. ",

It has approximately 630 beer brands in 150 countries.\n\nAB InBev was formed through InBev (itself a merger between Interbrew from Belgium and AmBev from Brazil) acquiring Anheuser-Busch from the United States.\n\nIn October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire South African multinational competitor SABMiller; the merger was concluded in October 2016. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods companies in the world. The annual sales for the company in 2019 were US$52.3 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016. The company was expected to have a 28 percent market share of global volume beer sales in 2017, according to Euromonitor International.\n\nSABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets.

The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. And, the Piedboeuf brewery established by 1812. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.\n AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or \"Beverages Company of the Americas\") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).\n Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri, US as Anheuser & Co.\n\nIn 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev. The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.\n\nAnheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer, in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.\n\nIn 2008, the acquisition by InBev of Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser-Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for US$70 per share in cash, for an aggregate of US$52 billion.\n\nIn 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined other alcohol producers in signing the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking's producers' commitments, an initiative to reducing harmful drinking.\n\nOn 21 July 2017, Anheuser-Busch InBev continued its investment in the non-alcohol beverage sector with the purchase of energy drink company Hiball.\n\nIn December 2018, Anheuser-Busch InBev partnered with cannabis producer Tilray to begin researching cannabis infused non-alcoholic beverages with Tilray subsidiary, High Park Company.\n\nTakeovers \nThe following is a diagram of AB InBev's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors, produced prior to the acquisition of SABMiller.\n\nInterbrew \n\nAfter the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, the second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.\n\nIn 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck's & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an initial public offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).\n\nIn 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K.

Military deserters move to canada, they are potentially liable for arrest due to outstanding arrest warrants in the united states. In order to avoid arrest and deportation, they need to attempt to legalize their status in canada. \n\nOne way to do this is by pursuing a refugee claim.

These decisions could involve judicial reviews, additional assessments like the \"pre removal risk assessment,\" or other legal processes.\n\nExamples of objectors granted a stay of deportation pending further decisions include:\n1. Corey glass: after being granted a stay, he was allowed to remain in canada until the federal court made a decision on cases for judicial review. He was transferred to the individual ready reserve (irr) and remains under army jurisdiction until they discharge him.\n \n2.

This treaty has implications for military deserters seeking refuge in canada, as desertion might be considered a crime, making them potentially liable for arrest.\n\nThe extradition treaty between the united states of america and canada facilitates the extradition of these individuals back to the united states. However, in accordance with the ruling of united states v. Burns from the supreme court of canada, the u.s. Government must promise that those extradited will not receive the death penalty.

Interstate 5 (i-5): sr 516 intersects i-5 at a partial cloverleaf interchange in western kent. Following the interchange, sr 516 continues as a four-lane divided highway.\n\n5. Green river and its pedestrian and bicycle trail: as sr 516 crosses the green river, it also spans the pedestrian and bicycle trail that follows the river.\n\n6. Downtown kent: the highway plays a crucial role in serving downtown kent, where it functions as the southern terminus of sr 181 before intersecting sr 167. The interchange with sr 167 is a diamond one located at the western edge of downtown kent.\n\n7. Interurban trail: as sr 516 veers south onto willis street, it crosses the interurban trail—a popular regional walking and biking path.\n\n8. Bnsf rail line: sr 516 crosses a bnsf rail line as it progresses east through the city of kent.\n\n9. Kent station: the highway turns north onto central avenue and east onto smith street near kent station, a major transit hub for the area.\n\n10. Kent-meridian high school: as sr 516 travels southeast along mill creek onto the kent-kangley road, it serves as the southern terminus of sr 515 at kent-meridian high school before exiting the city limits of kent.\n\n11. Covington: in covington, sr 516 follows 272nd street and passes lake meridian. It then intersects sr 18 at a diamond interchange located in the city.\n\n12. Pipe lake: east of covington, the highway continues past pipe lake and eventually enters maple valley.\n\n13. Cedar to green river trail: in maple valley, sr 516 crosses the cedar to green river trail, another regional walking and biking path.\n\n14. Sr 169 intersection: the eastern terminus of sr 516 is located in maple valley, where it intersects with sr 169.\n\nThese landmarks and locations contribute to the importance of sr 516 as a primary transportation route connecting several communities, commercial areas, educational institutions, and recreational facilities. \n\n<user> When was the kent-kangley road built? \n\n<assistant> The kent-kangley road, which forms a part of washington state route 516, was initially constructed as a wagon road by king county in the late 1890s. It served as an essential transportation route for local communities during that time.\n\nLater, in 1937, the route was upgraded to a paved highway when it was officially designated as two separate highways—secondary state highway 1k (ssh 1k) and secondary state highway 5a (ssh 5a)—during the creation of the primary and secondary state highways system. These separate designations focused on distinct sections of the route; ssh 1k covered the portion from des moines to kent, while ssh 5a spanned from kent to maple valley.\n\nThe two highways were eventually combined in the 1964 highway renumbering, leading to the formation of the current sr 516. This consolidation brought about a more unified and efficient highway system, further improving the transportation infrastructure linking communities in southern king county. \n\n<user> Sr 509's realignment in 1991? \n\n<assistant> In 1991, washington state route 509 (sr 509) underwent a realignment that affected its routing in conjunction with sr 516 and sr 99. Before the realignment, sr 509 had its own separate path. However, during the realignment, sr 509 was placed onto the same route as sr 516 and sr 99, creating new concurrencies between these highways. This means that, for a portion of their lengths, sr 509, sr 516, and sr 99 shared a single roadway.\n\nThe realignment served as a temporary measure while plans were underway for the completion of a new north-south freeway. Once the new freeway was constructed, sr 509 would be moved to follow this new route, eliminating the concurrency with sr 516 and sr 99.\n\nThe purpose of the realignment was to improve traffic flow, enhance safety, and increase efficiency along the highways, especially in areas with high traffic volumes or frequent congestion. Realignment projects such as this one are part of broader transportation initiatives aimed at optimizing and updating roadway infrastructure to better serve the evolving needs of drivers and communities.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> International mathematical olympiad? \n\n<assistant> Of course! The international mathematical olympiad (imo) is an annual competition for pre-college students, featuring six highly challenging mathematical problems. Established in 1959, it is the oldest among the international science olympiads. About 100 countries participate in this event, sending teams of up to six students, one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.\n\nThe problems at the imo cover a wide range of mathematical topics, including complex algebra, pre-calculus, projective and complex geometry, functional equations, and number theory. Although calculus is allowed in the solutions, it is not required as the problems are designed to be understood by anyone with a basic grasp of mathematics, but their solutions demand more advanced knowledge and ingenuity.\n\nThe selection process for the imo varies by country, usually involving a series of tests with gradually increasing difficulty. Students must be under 20 years old and cannot be registered at a tertiary institution. They can participate in the imo multiple times, subject to these conditions. Awards are given to a percentage of the individual contestants, while team scores are unofficially compared, putting more emphasis on individual achievements rather than team rankings.\n\nThe imo has a rich history, having been held every year since its inception, except in 1980, when it was canceled due to internal strife in mongolia. Originally founded for eastern european countries in the warsaw pact, the competition has expanded, and now other countries participate as well. Several students have excelled in the imo, winning multiple gold medals, and some former participants have become notable mathematicians and won prestigious awards like the fields medal.\n\nThe imo exam consists of six problems, each worth seven points, with a maximum total score of 42 points. The examination takes place over two days, with students given four-and-a-half hours each day to solve three problems. Problems can be submitted by participating countries, and the imo jury, comprising team leaders, selects the final six problems. \n\n<user> How do countries select their teams for the imo? \n\n<assistant> The selection process for imo teams varies greatly between countries. In some countries, particularly in east asia, a rigorous selection process consists of several tests with a difficulty level comparable to the imo itself. For example, chinese contestants go through a selection camp.\n\nIn other countries, such as the united states, potential team members participate in a series of standalone competitions that progressively increase in difficulty. The selection process includes multiple stages, such as the american mathematics competitions (amc), the american invitational mathematics examination (aime), and the united states of america mathematical olympiad (usamo), all of which are competitions in their own right. High-scoring students in the final competition may also be invited to a summer camp, similar to that in china.\n\nOverall, the selection process in each country aims to identify the best-performing students to represent them at the imo, through either a series of increasingly difficult contests or an intensive training camp. \n\n<user> How has google supported the international mathematical olympiad? \n\n<assistant> In january 2011, google made a significant contribution to the international mathematical olympiad by donating €1 million to the imo organization. This generous donation helped cover the costs of the global events for the next five years (from 2011 to 2015). Google's support demonstrates the company's commitment to promoting mathematical excellence and nurturing young talent in the field of mathematics.\n\nCorporate sponsorship and donations, like google's, are important for international competitions like the imo to maintain their operations and continue inspiring and educating talented students. Besides the financial support, such backing also serves to raise awareness and recognition of the competition and may encourage more students to participate in mathematical activities and strive for success in such prestigious events.\n\nAs a technology company with a deep focus on innovation, research, and development, google is actively involved in various initiatives that promote stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education. Supporting the international mathematical olympiad is a natural extension of this commitment and an effective way to contribute to fostering the next generation of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers who may one day make a significant impact in their respective fields. \n\n<user> Can you provide more details about the problems and format of the examination? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The international mathematical olympiad (imo) examination consists of six problems, each worth seven points, making the maximum total score 42 points. No calculators or other electronic devices are allowed during the examination.\n\nThe examination takes place over two consecutive days. On each day, contestants have four-and-a-half hours to work on and solve three problems. The problems are drawn from various areas of secondary school mathematics such as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. These problems do not require knowledge of higher mathematics like calculus or analysis. In fact, solutions to the problems are often short and elementary in nature. However, the problems are formulated in a way that disguises their solutions, making them difficult to decipher and requiring a high level of ingenuity to solve.\n\nThe problems often feature algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, although construction problems have become less popular in recent years.\n\nEach participating country, other than the host country, may submit suggested problems to the problem selection committee, provided by the host country. This committee then shortlists the submitted problems. The imo jury, comprised of arriving team leaders, is responsible for all formal decisions related to the contest, including selecting the final six problems from the shortlist. The jury strives to order the problems in increasing difficulty from q1 to q6.\n\nAs team leaders know the problems in advance, they are kept strictly separated and under observation to ensure fairness. The contestants' scores are then determined through an agreement between the leader and deputy leader of each country and coordinators provided by the host country. In case of disputes, the chief coordinator or the imo jury can be involved in resolving the issue. ",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I've been looking into decision making processes, and i came across something called the priority heuristic. can you please explain what it is, how it works, and how it predicts classic violations of expected utility theory, such as the allais paradox or the certainty effect? i would really appreciate a brief overview and some examples of its application. \n\n<assistant> The priority heuristic is a simple, lexicographic decision-making strategy that correctly predicts classic violations of expected utility theory, like the allais paradox, four-fold pattern, certainty effect, possibility effect, and intransitivities. It builds on rubinstein's three-step model and is designed to help people make choices between gambles in a systematic and efficient manner.\n\nThe priority heuristic consists of three steps: priority rule, stopping rule, and decision rule. In the priority rule, reasons for choosing between gambles are examined in this order: minimum gain, chance of minimum gain, and maximum gain. The stopping rule determines when to stop comparing factors - either when minimum gains differ by 1/10 (or more) of the maximum gain or when chances differ by 10% (or more). Finally, the decision rule chooses the gamble with the more attractive gain (chance).\n\nThis heuristic can predict the majority choice in many classic decision-making problems like the allais paradox or the certainty effect by using this simple, structured approach to evaluate and compare gambles. Let me provide examples in the next response. \n\n<user> Thanks for the explanation! can you please give detailed examples of how the priority heuristic is applied to decision-making problems like the allais paradox, and other choice problems like the one you mentioned, which were developed to support prospect theory? i'd appreciate it if you could describe the problems and how the priority heuristic can predict majority choices. \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Let's look at two choice problems designed to support prospect theory and see how the priority heuristic predicts the majority choices.\n\nProblem 1:\nGamble a: 80% chance to win 4,000; 20% chance to win nothing.\nGamble b: 100% chance to win 3,000.\n\nMost people choose b (80%). The priority heuristic compares the minimum gains (0 for a and 3,000 for b). The difference is 3,000, which exceeds 400 (10% of the maximum gain). Examination stops, and people are predicted to prefer the sure gain b, aligning with the majority choice.\n\nProblem 2:\nGamble c: 45% chance to win 6,000; 55% chance to win nothing.\nGamble d: 90% chance to win 3,000; 10% chance to win nothing.\n\nMost people choose d (86%). The priority heuristic compares minimum gains (0 and 0), leading to a comparison of probabilities (0.45 and 0.90). This difference exceeds 10%, so examination stops, and people are predicted to choose d due to its higher probability of winning.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the predictive power of the priority heuristic in decision-making problems and its ability to capture behavioral patterns observed in classic experiments. \n\n<user> I'm still a bit confused about these steps and rules of the priority heuristic. can you please explain them to me in simpler terms or like you would to a child? would it be possible to provide a basic example to help me understand the concept better? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Let me explain the priority heuristic in simpler terms.\n\nImagine you're choosing between two mystery boxes, and each box gives you a prize. The prizes can be toys, and the priority heuristic helps you decide which box to pick. The steps are:\n\n1. Priority rule: you check three things in order: the least cool toy (minimum gain), the chance of getting the least cool toy (chance of minimum gain), and the coolest toy (maximum gain).\n\n2. Stopping rule: you stop checking when you find a big enough difference between boxes. For example, if one box has way cooler toys (1/10 or more of the coolest toy), or if one box has a much higher chance (10% or more) of giving you the least cool toy.\n\n3. Decision rule: you pick the box with the cooler toys (higher gain) or the box with a smaller chance of giving you the least cool toy.\n\nNow, let's say you have two mystery boxes:\n\nBox a: 8/10 chance of getting a cool robot; 2/10 chance of getting an empty box.\nBox b: 10/10 chance of getting a neat action figure.\n\nWith the priority heuristic, you check the least cool prize, (empty box for a and action figure for b). The difference (empty vs. Action figure) is big enough, so you stop and choose box b because it has a cooler guaranteed prize.\n\nThis simple example demonstrates the steps of the priority heuristic while making it easier to understand for a younger audience. \n\n<user> Is the priority heuristic always accurate in predicting people's choices?

        "reference": "The priority heuristic is a simple, lexicographic decision strategy that correctly predicts classic violations of expected utility theory such as the Allais paradox, the four-fold pattern, the certainty effect, the possibility effect, or intransitivities. \n\nThe heuristic maps onto Rubinstein’s three-step model, according to which people first check dominance and stop if it is present, otherwise they check for dissimilarity. To highlight Rubinstein’s model consider the following choice problem:\n\nI: 50% chance to win 2,000\n50% chance to win nothing\n\nII: 52% chance to win 1,000\n48% chance to win nothing\n\nDominance is absent, and while chances are similar monetary outcomes are not. Rubinstein’s model predicts that people check for dissimilarity and consequently choose Gamble I. Unfortunately, dissimilarity checks are often not decisive, and Rubinstein suggested that people proceed to a third step that he left unspecified. The priority heuristic elaborates on Rubinstein’s framework by specifying this Step 3.\n\nPriority heuristic \nFor illustrative purposes consider a choice between two simple gambles of the type “a chance c of winning monetary amount x; a chance (100 - c) of winning amount y.” A choice between two such gambles contain four reasons for choosing: the maximum gain, the minimum gain, and their respective chances; because chances are complementary, three reasons remain: the minimum gain, the chance of the minimum gain, and the maximum gain.\n\nFor choices between gambles in which all outcomes are positive or 0, the priority heuristic consists of the following three steps (for all other choices see Brandstätter et al. 2006):\n\nPriority rule: Go through reasons in the order of minimum gain, the chance of minimum gain, and maximum gain.\n\nStopping rule: Stop examination if the minimum gains differ by 1/10 (or more) of the maximum gain; otherwise, stop examination if chances differ by 10% (or more).\n\nDecision rule: Choose the gamble with the more attractive gain (chance). The term “attractive” refers to the gamble with the higher (minimum or maximum) gain and to the lower chance of the minimum gain.\n\nExamples \nConsider the following two choice problems, which were developed to support prospect theory, not the priority heuristic.\n\nProblem 1\nA: 80% chance to win 4,000\n20% chance to win nothing\nB: 100% chance to win 3,000\n\nMost people chose B (80%). The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains of the Gambles A (0) and B (3,000). The difference is 3,000, which is larger than 400 (10% of the maximum gain), the examination is stopped; and the heuristic predicts that people prefer the sure gain B, which is in fact the majority choice.A\n\nProblem 2\nC: 45% chance to win 6,000\n55% chance to win nothing\nD: 90% chance to win 3,000 \n10% chance to win nothing\n\nMost people (86%) chose Gamble D. The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains (0 and 0). Because they do not differ, the probabilities (.45 and .90 or their logical complements .55 and .10) are compared. This difference is larger than 10%, examination stops and people are correctly predicted to choose D because of its higher probability of winning.\n\nEmpirical support and limitations \nThe priority heuristic correctly predicted the majority choice in all (one-stage) gambles in Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Across four different data sets with a total of 260 problems, the heuristic predicted the majority choice better than (a) cumulative prospect theory, (b) two other modifications of expected utility theory, and (c) ten well-known heuristics (such as minimax or equal-weight) did. However, the priority heuristic fails to predict many simple decisions (that are typically not tested in experiments) and has no free parameters (which means that it cannot explain the heterogeneity of decisions between subjects), which triggered criticism,\nand countercriticism.\n\nSee also\n Mathematics\n Economics\n Combinatorics\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/eb/EB_Priority_2006.pdf\n\nHeuristics",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I've been experiencing muscle weakness and skin rashes lately. can you provide more information about these symptoms and what condition they might be associated with? \n\n<assistant> Your symptoms could be indicative of a condition called dermatomyositis (dm). This is a long-term inflammatory disorder that affects skin and muscles. The main symptoms include a skin rash and worsening muscle weakness over time, which may occur suddenly or develop over months. The skin rash could be purplish, red, or lilac and appear around the eyes, on the upper chest or back, and other areas like the upper arms, thighs, or hands. Gottron's sign, which involves red or violet papules, may also be present on finger joints or other bony prominences.\n\nOther possible symptoms of dm include weight loss, fever, lung inflammation, or light sensitivity. Complications might involve calcium deposits in muscles or skin. Although the exact cause is unknown, theories suggest it could be an autoimmune disease or the result of a viral infection. Dermatomyositis might also develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome related to various cancers. To diagnose this condition, a combination of symptoms, blood tests, electromyography, and muscle biopsies are typically used.\n\nIf you are concerned about these symptoms, it is important to consult a healthcare professional to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatments usually improve symptoms and can consist of medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics and assistive devices, and rest. \n\n<user> What treatments are commonly prescribed? \n\n<assistant> For dermatomyositis, the treatment plan usually involves medications, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics, and rest to help manage symptoms and improve the condition. The most common medications prescribed for dm are corticosteroids, which help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. If steroids are not working well, other agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be recommended. Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) may help improve the outcomes for some patients.\n\nThe physical therapy goals typically include increasing muscle strength, maintaining flexibility, and improving overall function. Therapeutic exercises are designed to address the specific muscle groups affected by this condition. Heat therapy can help relieve muscle pain and stiffness, and orthotics or assistive devices, like canes, walkers, or braces, can be utilized for better support and mobility. Adequate rest is also crucial as it allows the body to recover from the inflammation.\n\nIt is essential to work with a healthcare professional to develop a personalized treatment plan based on individual needs and specific symptoms. \n\n<user> Are certain people at a higher risk for developing dermatomyositis? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there are certain factors that may increase an individual's risk of developing dermatomyositis. The condition usually affects people in their 40s and 50s. Interestingly, women are more likely to be affected than men. However, people of any age may develop dm, including children and the elderly.\n\nCertain cases of the condition may also be linked with an individual's genetic makeup. Hla subtypes, such as hla-dr3, hla-dr52, and hla-dr6, have been associated with a predisposition to autoimmune dermatomyositis. Another known risk factor is its association with malignancy. This condition can develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome in relation to various forms of cancer, including ovarian, breast, and lung cancers. The risk of developing malignancy in association with dermatomyositis increases after age 60.\n\nIt is essential to be aware of these risk factors and to consult with a healthcare professional if you experience any persistent symptoms associated with dm. \n\n<user> How can i manage to live a normal life while dealing with dermatomyositis? \n\n<assistant> Living with dermatomyositis can be challenging, but there are ways to manage the condition and maintain a good quality of life. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Collaboration with healthcare professionals: work closely with your doctors, therapists, and specialists to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and helps control symptoms.\n\n2. Medication adherence: follow your prescribed medication schedule and always consult your doctor before making any changes.\n\n3. Exercise and physical therapy: regularly participate in physical therapy and appropriate exercise routines, as these can help maintain muscle strength, flexibility, and overall function.\n\n4. Heat therapy: consider using heat therapy to alleviate muscle pain and stiffness.\n\n5. Assistive devices: utilize orthotics and assistive devices that can improve mobility and provide support, like canes, walkers, or braces.\n\n6. Rest: ensure that you get adequate rest, as it allows your body to recover from inflammation.\n\n7. Emotional support: seek support from family, friends, or support groups, as dealing with a chronic condition can be emotionally challenging.\n\n8. Sun protection: since sunlight may exacerbate rashes in some dm cases, take precautions like wearing sun-protective clothing, using sunscreen, and avoiding unnecessary sun exposure.\n\n9. Monitor for potential complications: keep track of any changes in symptoms, and report them to your healthcare provider.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and maintaining open communication with your healthcare team, you can manage dermatomyositis' impact on your daily life and maintain a good quality of life.

Medications in the corticosteroids family are typically used with other agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine recommended if steroids are not working well. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also improve outcomes. Most people improve with treatment and in some, the condition resolves completely.\n\nAbout one per 100,000 people per year are newly affected. The condition usually occurs in those in their 40s and 50s with women being affected more often than men. People of any age, however, may be affected. The condition was first described in the 1800s.\n\nSigns and symptoms \nThe main symptoms include several kinds of skin rash along with muscle weakness in both upper arms or thighs.\n\nSkin \nOne form the rashes take is called \"heliotrope\" (a purplish color) or lilac, but may also be red. It can occur around the eyes along with swelling, but also occurs on the upper chest or back what is called the \"shawl\" (around the neck) or \"V-sign\" above the breasts and may also occur on the face, upper arms, thighs, or hands.  Another form the rash takes is called Gottron's sign which are red or violet, sometimes scaly, slightly raised papules that erupt on any of the finger joints (the metacarpophalangeal joints or the interphalangeal joints). Gottron's papules may also be found over other bony prominences including the elbows, knees, or feet. All these rashes are made worse by exposure to sunlight, and are often very itchy, painful, and may bleed.\n\nIf a person exhibits only skin findings characteristic of DM, without weakness or abnormal muscle enzymes, then he or she may be experiencing amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM), formerly known as \"dermatomyositis sine myositis\".\n\nMuscles \nPeople with DM experience progressively worsening muscle weakness in the proximal muscles (for example, the shoulders and thighs). Tasks that use these muscles: standing from sitting, lifting, and climbing stairs, can become increasingly difficult for people with dermatomyositis.\n\nOther \nAround 30% of people have swollen, painful joints, but this is generally mild.\n\nIn some people, the condition affects the lungs, and they may have a cough or difficulty breathing.  If the condition affects the heart,  arrhythmias may occur. If it affects the blood vessels in the stomach or intestines, which is more common in juvenile DM, the people might vomit blood, have black tarry bowel movements, or may develop a hole somewhere in their GI tract.\n\nCauses \n\nThe cause is unknown, but it may result from an initial viral infection or cancer, either of which could raise an autoimmune response.\n\nBetween 7 and 30% of dermatomyositis arise from cancer, probably as an autoimmune response. The most commonly associated cancers are ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer.  18 to 25% of people with amyopathic DM also have cancer. Malignancy in association with dermatomyositis is more prevalent after age 60.\n\nSome cases are inherited, and HLA subtypes HLA-DR3, HLA-DR52, and HLA-DR6 seem to create a disposition to autoimmune dermatomyositis.",

The symptoms of aml are caused by the replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which results in a decrease in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells.\n\nCommon symptoms of aml include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and an increased risk of infection. Early signs can be vague and nonspecific, similar to flu or other common illnesses. Some generalized symptoms include fever, weight loss or loss of appetite, anemia, petechiae (small, pin-head-sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding), bone and joint pain, and persistent or frequent infections. Enlargement of the spleen is also possible but usually mild and asymptomatic. Swelling of the gums can occur due to the infiltration of leukemic cells into gum tissue. In rare cases, a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow, called a chloroma, may develop.\n\nSeveral risk factors for developing aml have been identified, including preexisting blood disorders, chemical exposure, ionizing radiation, and genetics. Preleukemic blood disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) or myeloproliferative disease (mps) can evolve into aml. Exposure to anticancer chemotherapy, especially alkylating agents, can increase the risk of developing aml, with the highest risk being three to five years after chemotherapy. Occupational chemical exposure to benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial, but some studies have suggested a link between exposure and an increased risk of aml.\n\nHigh amounts of ionizing radiation exposure can also increase the risk of aml. Survivors of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki had an increased rate of aml, as did radiologists exposed to high levels of x-rays before modern radiation safety practices. Some congenital conditions like down syndrome are associated with a higher risk of aml. \n\n<user> How is aml diagnosed and treated? \n\n<assistant> The first clue to an aml diagnosis often comes from an abnormal result on a complete blood count. Abnormal white blood cells or leukemic blasts may be seen, and aml can present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low white blood cell count (leukopenia).\n\nAml has several subtypes, and treatment and prognosis vary among them. It is cured in 35-40% of people less than 60 years old and 5-15% of people more than 60 years old. For older individuals who cannot withstand intensive chemotherapy, the average survival is 5-10 months.\n\nAml is initially treated with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission. Following remission, patients may receive additional chemotherapy or undergo a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into aml genetics has resulted in tests that can predict which medication may work best for a particular individual, as well as their likely survival duration.\n\nThe treatment and prognosis of aml differ from chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml) due to differences in cellular differentiation. Aml involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts). \n\n<user> How can aml be prevented? \n\n<assistant> Preventing aml is challenging since the exact cause of the disease is not clear, and many risk factors cannot be controlled. However, there are some measures that one can take to reduce the risk of developing aml or address certain modifiable risk factors:\n\n1. Avoid exposure to harmful chemicals: limit occupational exposure to known carcinogens like benzene and other aromatic organic solvents as much as possible by following safety regulations and using appropriate personal protective equipment.\n\n2. Limit unnecessary radiation exposure: while some medical imaging tests are necessary, try to reduce exposure to ionizing radiation when possible. Only undergo tests when recommended by a healthcare professional.\n\n3. Regular checkups: individuals with pre-existing blood disorders such as mds or mps should consult their healthcare provider for regular checkups and monitoring, as these conditions may evolve into aml.\n\n4. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: while this may not directly prevent aml, practicing good health habits like eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking can improve overall health and help the body's immune system function better to fight off diseases. \n\n<user> What is leukemia cutis? \n\n<assistant> Leukemia cutis is a rare condition where leukemic cells infiltrate the skin, resulting in skin lesions. It is associated with aml in approximately 10% of cases. Leukemia cutis can manifest as a wide range of skin lesions, such as papules, nodules, plaques, or ulcers, and may be single or multiple. The lesions can vary in color from red, purple, or brown, and may be itchy or painful in some cases.\n\nLeukemia cutis is not exclusive to aml; it can also appear in other types of leukemia such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. The presence of leukemia cutis is significant because it often indicates a more aggressive disease course or an advanced stage of leukemia. In some cases, leukemia cutis may be the first sign of the disease, even before the leukemia is diagnosed from blood tests.\n\nDiagnosis of leukemia cutis is based on clinical presentation, skin biopsy, and histopathological examination of the skin sample to confirm the presence of leukemic cells. Treatment for leukemia cutis involves treating the underlying leukemia itself. This may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, depending on the specific type of leukemia and the patient’s overall health.\n\nIn summary, leukemia cutis is a rare skin manifestation of leukemia, and its presence often indicates a more aggressive disease. Proper treatment of the underlying leukemia is crucial for the management of leukemia cutis. ",

        "reference": "St Philip's Church is a Church of England parish church in Hove, in the city of Brighton and Hove, England. It was opened in 1895 and consecrated in 1898 on New Church Road, near Aldrington's parish church of St Leonard's. It has come under threat of closure but is still active as of 2012. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nHistory\nThe road now named New Church Road is the old route between the ancient villages of Hove and Aldrington. There was some Roman and Saxon activity at Aldrington, but severe decline set in during the 18th and 19th centuries, such that only one person was living there by 1831. The rapid residential growth of Hove in the mid-19th century stimulated development in Aldrington from around 1850, however, and St Leonard's Church was rebuilt from its ruined state to serve the area. By 1894, Aldrington and Hove had merged, and the population of Aldrington alone exceeded 2,200. It was decided that a chapel of ease was needed to serve the area east of St Leonard's Church. Its rector bought land from the Duke of Portland in November of that year and commissioned Sir George Gilbert Scott's son John Oldrid Scott to design a church.\n\nBuilding work took less than a year: the first service at St Philip's took place on 28 October 1895. The consecration ceremony was not held until 29 May 1898, however. By that date, £5,492.15s.10d (£ in ) had been spent on construction and the land. It was extended at a cost of about £4,000 (£ in ) between 1909 and 1910, at which point the deeds transferring ownership of the land from the Duke of Portland to the rector of St Leonard's Church was found to be invalid. A new arrangement was drawn up and the church became the property of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. In 1912 it gained its own benefice and parish, which still exists as of 2012 and which has had ten vicars since its creation.\n\nAnother extension was added in 1941: architecture firm Tetley and Felce designed and added a porch. The west end of the church was converted into a hall in 1956; a large (300 sq ft) Sussex-themed mural was painted on the dividing wall by the muralist Augustus Lunn in 1957 and 1958. \n\nThe church received national attention in its centenary year when an edition of the long-running BBC Radio programme Any Questions? was recorded there.

There are two primary types of safe areas: title-safe and action-safe areas.\n\nTitle-safe area is a rectangular region far enough from the edges of the screen where text or graphics can be displayed neatly, without distortion. This area ensures that elements like lower thirds or full-screen graphics maintain their readability and visibility without being cut off, even if displayed on older televisions or devices with different screen sizes.\n\nAction-safe area is an extended rectangle that surrounds the title-safe area. This area creates a margin or buffer space around the screen so that visual elements don't crowd the screen's edge, maintaining a clean and clutter-free look. Tv stations and networks typically place crucial information within the action-safe area.\n\nOlder televisions may have a smaller viewable area compared to modern flat-panel, plasma, or lcd screens. By using safe areas during production, content creators can make sure that their target audience can view the most important parts of the picture, even on a variety of different television screens. This approach minimizes the risk of distortion or content loss caused by variations in television hardware and settings. In addition, different broadcast standards like ntsc and pal also affect how the content is displayed. So, safe areas provide a consistent way to ensure that the relevant information is visible on most screens. \n\n<user> Can you clarify the differences between the action-safe area, title-safe area, and overscan? also, how are digital compression technologies like mpeg-4 related to these areas? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Let's first recap their definitions:\n\n1. Title-safe area: this is the innermost rectangle where text and graphics can be displayed without distortion or being cut off on most television screens. Content placed in this area remains legible and undistorted, ensuring that essential information is accessible to viewers.\n\n2. Action-safe area: this is a larger rectangle that includes the title-safe area, extending outward from it. The purpose of the action-safe area is to provide a buffer or margin around the screen, so elements don't appear too close to the edge, maintaining a neat presentation. Important visual content is typically placed within this region to cater to a wider range of television screen sizes and display settings.\n\n3. Overscan: this is the area outside the action-safe area, often not displayed on consumer television screens unless the user modifies their tv settings. The overscan area is where elements not meant to be seen by viewers can be placed, like the edge of a set or cables.\n\nAs for digital compression technologies like mpeg-4, these video codecs compress only the active picture area, which includes both action-safe and title-safe areas (plus the overscan). In other words, mpeg-4 and similar codecs focus on compressing the actual visible content and not the blanking intervals or other parts of the broadcast signal. By doing so, they optimize compression efficiency and work effectively with the digital distribution of video content.\n\nMpeg-2, an older codec, is closely tied to analog broadcasting and has limited size options. Thus, it might capture some nominal analog blanking regions in addition to the active picture. Modern codecs like mpeg-4 accommodate only the genuine active picture and are designed specifically to work with digital distribution methods. \n\n<user> How does aspect ratio relate to the use of safe areas and overscan? \n\n<assistant> Aspect ratio plays a significant role in determining how safe areas and overscan function in television production.\n\nAspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of the video frame. There are multiple aspect ratios, but the most common ones are 4:3 for standard-definition content and 16:9 for high-definition and widescreen content.\n\nWhen producing content in a 4:3 aspect ratio, the entire active picture, which includes the action-safe area and overscan, is transmitted to fill the screen horizontally, with no black areas around the edges. Since various television screens might display the content differently, using the safe areas ensures that essential parts of the picture, both visually and textually, are visible to most viewers, regardless of their television screen or aspect ratio.\n\nFor widescreen programming, 14:9 or 16:9 aspect ratios are commonly used. These formats often have zero overscan at the top and bottom of the picture, where letterbox bars appear on a 4:3 television screen. This approach prevents unintentional content loss or distortion when the picture is displayed on different screen sizes or aspect ratios.\n\nUsing safe areas in alignment with different aspect ratios ensures that crucial visual and textual content remains visible and undistorted on various television screens with specific aspect ratio conventions, accommodating both old and new screens, as well as various broadcast standards. \n\n<user> In video editing software, how can one make sure that titles and text stay within the title-safe area and what examples can you provide of software that offers ways to manage safe areas? \n\n<assistant> Video editing software often provides tools and features to help users manage safe areas and ensure titles and text stay within the title-safe area.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n1. Safe area overlays or guidelines: many video editing applications have a built-in feature that shows safe area overlays or guidelines. These overlays usually consist of two rectangular outlines: one for the title-safe area and another for the action-safe area. Users can enable these guidelines on the editing software's preview or canvas screen to ensure their text and graphics are positioned within the title-safe area.\n\n2. Safe margins for export: several video editing programs provide export settings specifically designed for television or web delivery. These settings let users adjust safe margins or choose relevant presets. For example, in apple's imovie, users are advised to uncheck the \"qt margins\" checkbox when exporting content for television, ensuring that the titles stay within the title-safe area.\n\n3. Resizing and scaling tools: some editing packages come with resizing and scaling features that allow users to manipulate elements like text or graphics and easily fit them within the title-safe area. These functions help users maintain the visual quality and legibility of the elements, making sure they fit within the safe boundaries.\n\nA few examples of video editing software packages that offer tools to manage safe areas:\n- final cut pro: apple's professional-grade video editing software provides overlay rectangles to show the title-safe and action-safe areas in both the viewer and canvas.\n- adobe premiere pro: in premiere pro, users can enable an option called \"safe margins\" in the program monitor to display title-safe and action-safe overlays.\n- avid media composer: this software also offers safe area overlays that can be enabled as part of the interface settings.\n\nUsing these tools in video editing software ensures that the content creators position titles, text, and other essential graphic elements within the designated safe areas, preventing distortion or loss of information when displayed on various television screens.

The NTSC and PAL analog television standards do not specify official overscan amounts, and producers of television programming use their own guidelines.\n\nSome video editing software packages for non-linear editing systems (NLE) solutions have a setting which shows the safe areas while editing.\n\nTitle-safe area \n\nThe title-safe area or graphics-safe area is, in television broadcasting, a rectangular area which is far enough in from the four edges, such that text or graphics show neatly: with a margin and without distortion.  This is applied against a worst case of on-screen location and display type.  Typically corners would require more space from the edges, but due to increased quality of the average display this is no longer the concern it used to be, even on CRTs.\n\nIf the editor of the content does not take care to ensure that all titles are inside the title-safe area, some titles in the content could have their edges chopped off when viewed in some screens.\n\nVideo editing programs that can output video for either television or the Web can take the title-safe area into account. In Apple's consumer-grade NLE software iMovie, the user is advised to uncheck the QT Margins checkbox for content meant for television, and to check it for content meant only for QuickTime on a computer. Final Cut Pro can show two overlay rectangles in both its Viewer and Canvas; the inner rectangle is the title-safe area and the outer rectangle is the action-safe area.\n\nIn the illustration, the green area is referred to as the \"title-safe\" area (note that these colors are for illustration only and do not appear on the television screens). This area will be seen by all television screens, no matter when they were made, unless the user has modified the settings. The term \"title-safe\" originated from the fact this is where it is safe to display text such as lower thirds or full-screen graphics listing information such as telephone numbers.\n\nAction-safe area \nDepending on how a television set is adjusted, viewers can see a larger area than the title-safe area.  The action-safe area is a larger rectangle, consisting of the green title-safe area and a rectangle around it shown in yellow.  , most television stations and networks will place information within this area. This area can be considered the \"margin\" of the television screen in that picture elements are generally kept out of this area to create a buffer around the edge of the screen so elements don't pile up against the edge of the screen. If the station uses a permanent digital on-screen graphic, it is placed just near the corner of the yellow area.\n\nHowever, the yellow area might be used if the television station wants the information to block against the edge of the screen. Many stations (e.g. BBC News) place tickers that run horizontally in some of the yellow area.\n\nAction-safe area is applied against a worst case of on-screen location and display type.\n\nOverscan \n\nThe red border in the illustration represents the overscan, the area of the active picture outside the action-safe area. It is not shown on most consumer television screens, unless the user modifies the television's settings. It is generally considered safe to have elements that shouldn't be seen by the viewers placed in this area, such as the edge of the set or cables and other equipment. However, some television production personnel don't place anything in this area they don't want viewers to see because the red area is always transmitted and could potentially be seen by a viewer with the correct equipment. Television stations generally have professional-grade monitors that can be put into \"underscan\" mode. These monitors often include white lines showing where the title-safe and safe areas are located. In addition, TV tuner cards and DVD players for personal computers often show the entire picture.\n\nThe action-safe area (green + yellow) and overscan area (red) make up the entire transmitted image, or active picture.\n\nIn addition to active picture, analog broadcast signals contain blanking areas that provide timings and control.  When applying digital compression such as MPEG-4, it is only sensible to compress picture that actually exists, and active picture is what is used — including areas not available in action-safe areas.  (MPEG-2 is a bad example, since it has many ties to analogue broadcasting, and employs only a few set sizes;  this is why it will always capture nominal analogue blanking in addition to the active picture next to it.)\n\nSince there are such a wide variety of television screens that may display pictures slightly differently, programs produced in 4:3 aspect ratio are transmitted with picture information in the yellow and red areas to ensure the picture takes up the entire screen with no black area around the edges.\nWidescreen programs in 14:9 or 16:9 aspect ratio, on the other hand, are produced with zero overscan at the top and bottom of the picture, where the letterbox bars appear on a 4:3 television.\n\nReferences\n\nTelevision terminology\nTelevision technology",

He was the second of five children born to samuel booth and his second wife, mary moss. Samuel booth was relatively well-off by the standards of the time, but the family fell into poverty during william's childhood. In 1842, unable to afford his son's school fees, samuel apprenticed the 13-year-old william to a pawnbroker. On september 23, 1842, samuel booth passed away.\n\nTwo years into his apprenticeship, william experienced a religious conversion. This led him to read extensively, refine his writing and speaking skills, and become a methodist local preacher. His best friend, will sansom, encouraged him to pursue evangelism. Together, they preached to the poor and sinners of nottingham. However, sansom passed away due to tuberculosis in 1849.\n\nAfter completing his apprenticeship in 1848, william struggled to find employment for a year. In 1849, he reluctantly left his family and moved to london, where he found work with another pawnbroker. He attempted to continue lay preaching but became frustrated with the limited opportunities. Eventually, he resigned as a lay preacher and shifted to open-air evangelism in the streets and on kennington common.\n\nIn 1851, booth joined the reformers (methodist reform church) as a full-time preacher. On may 15, 1852, he became engaged to catherine mumford. They married on june 16, 1855, at stockwell green congregational church in london, and their partnership significantly influenced the future founding of the salvation army. \n\n<user> What led booth to establish the salvation army? \n\n<assistant> William booth's experience as a methodist evangelist, along with his desire to help the poor and marginalized, contributed to the founding of the salvation army. He became disillusioned with the methodist denomination's refusal to let him engage in full-time evangelism, so he eventually resigned and began working as an independent evangelist.\n\nIn 1865, booth and his wife catherine opened 'the christian revival society' in the east end of london. This organization aimed to spread the christian message of repentance and salvation to the poor and disadvantaged. It was later renamed the christian mission.\n\nDespite the initially slow growth of the christian mission, booth persisted in helping the needy through charitable acts like running soup kitchens under the name \"food for the million.\" in may 1878, an incident led to the organization's renaming; while dictating a letter, william booth referred to his group as a \"volunteer army.\" his son bramwell objected, stating that he was a \"regular,\" not a volunteer. Consequently, the term \"salvation\" replaced \"volunteer,\" and thus, the salvation army was born.\n\nThe salvation army adopted a quasi-military structure, with booth becoming its first \"general.\" members wore uniforms and had ranks such as \"officers\" and \"soldiers.\" the organization expanded rapidly, and by the early 1880s, it had extended to numerous countries, including the united states, france, switzerland, sweden, australia, canada, india, new zealand, and jamaica. Today, the salvation army is one of the world's largest distributors of humanitarian aid. \n\n<user> Can you describe the role that catherine booth played in the salvation army, as well as the influence she had in shaping its activities and values? \n\n<assistant> Catherine booth played a crucial role in the formation and development of the salvation army. As william booth's wife and partner, she took an active role in the organization, both as a leader and an influential thinker. Catherine was an accomplished preacher, writer, and advocate for social reform, which helped shape the organization's values and objectives.\n\nCatherine booth is often referred to as the \"mother of the salvation army.\" she contributed significantly to the development of the army's social work and ministry, affirming the belief that christian faith must manifest in practical ways to improve people's lives. She passionately championed the cause of social reform, advocating for women's rights and better working conditions, combating child labor, and supporting the temperance movement.\n\nCatherine was an eloquent speaker and frequently preached at salvation army meetings. Her conviction that women should be allowed to preach and hold leadership roles within the church was revolutionary for her time, and her efforts paved the way for female ministry within the salvation army.\n\nUnder her influence, the salvation army became involved in providing food, shelter, and assistance to those suffering from poverty and addiction. Catherine also pushed for the establishment of rescue homes to help vulnerable women escape dangerous situations, including prostitution.\n\nOverall, catherine booth's strong values, dedication, and leadership skills significantly contributed to the salvation army's direction and values, ensuring its commitment to social reform and the support of marginalized populations. \n\n<user> How did the salvation army adopt a military-style structure, and why did it use uniforms and ranks for its members? \n\n<assistant> The salvation army adopted a military-style structure as a way to instill discipline, order, and a sense of unity among its members. This approach was reflective of the organization's commitment to fighting social and spiritual battles on behalf of the poor and downtrodden. Additionally, the military structure created a clear hierarchy, which enabled the organization to function effectively and consistently across various locations and international branches.\n\nThe use of uniforms and ranks emphasized the commitment of salvation army members to their cause, further solidifying their identity as \"soldiers\" in the fight against poverty, injustice, and sin. Uniforms provided a visible symbol of the organization and its values, making its presence known in public spaces and inspiring a sense of camaraderie among its members. Furthermore, uniforms signaled the army's non-partisan approach, as its members offered assistance to any individuals in need, regardless of race, religion, or background.\n\nThe ranks within the salvation army, such as \"officers\" and \"soldiers,\" allowed for the distribution of responsibilities and duties, ensuring that tasks were allocated based on aptitude and experience. This hierarchical structure contributed to the efficient functioning of the organization and supported its efforts in outreach, evangelism, social work, and administration.\n\nIn summary, the salvation army's adoption of a military-style structure, uniforms, and ranks served multiple purposes in promoting discipline, unity, and efficiency within the organization. It allowed for clear communication of the army's mission and values, while also fostering a sense of belonging and purpose among its members as they united to tackle the social and spiritual challenges facing their communities.

        "reference": "William Booth (10 April 182920 August 1912) was an English Methodist preacher who, along with his wife, Catherine, founded the Salvation Army and became its first \"General\" (1878–1912). The Christian movement with a quasi-military structure and government founded in 1865 has spread from London, England, to many parts of the world and is known for being one of the largest distributors of humanitarian aid. In 2002, Booth was named among the 100 Greatest Britons in a BBC poll.\n\nConversion and early ministry\n\nWilliam Booth was born in Sneinton, Nottingham, the second son of five children born to Samuel Booth and his second wife, Mary Moss. Booth's father was relatively wealthy by the standards of the time, but during William's childhood, the family descended into poverty. In 1842, Samuel Booth, who could no longer afford his son's school fees, apprenticed the 13-year-old William Booth to a pawnbroker. Samuel Booth died on 23 September 1842.\n\nTwo years into his apprenticeship Booth was converted. He then read extensively and trained himself in writing and in speech, becoming a Methodist local preacher. Booth was encouraged to be an evangelist primarily through his best friend, Will Sansom. Sansom and Booth both began in the 1840s to preach to the poor and the sinners of Nottingham, and Booth would probably have remained as Sansom's partner in his new Mission ministry, as Sansom titled it, if Sansom had not died of tuberculosis, in 1849.\n\nWhen his apprenticeship ended in 1848, Booth was unemployed and spent a year looking in vain for work. In 1849, Booth reluctantly left his family and moved to London, where he again found work with a pawnbroker. Booth tried to continue lay preaching in London, but the small amount of preaching work that came his way frustrated him, and so he resigned as a lay preacher and took to open-air evangelising in the streets and on Kennington Common.\n\nIn 1851, Booth joined the Reformers (Methodist Reform Church), and on 10 April 1852, his 23rd birthday, he left pawnbroking and became a full-time preacher at their headquarters at Binfield Chapel in Clapham. William styled his preaching after the revivalist American James Caughey, who had made frequent visits to England and preached at the church in Nottingham where Booth was a member, Broad Street Chapel. Just over a month after he started full-time preaching, on 15 May 1852, William Booth became formally engaged to Catherine Mumford.\n\nInterested in the Congregationalist approach, Booth consulted David Thomas at Stockwell about the ministry. Through Thomas, he met John Campbell and then James William Massie. The recommendation was training under Rev. John Frost; but Booth disliked Frost's school, and left shortly. In November 1853, he was invited to become the Reformers' minister at Spalding, in Lincolnshire. He married Catherine Mumford on 16 June 1855 at Stockwell Green Congregational Church in London.\n\nThough Booth became a prominent Methodist evangelist, he was unhappy that the annual conference of the denomination kept assigning him to a pastorate, the duties of which he had to neglect to respond to the frequent requests that he do evangelistic campaigns. At the Liverpool conference in 1861, after having spent three years at Gateshead, his request to be freed for evangelism full-time was refused yet again, and Booth resigned from the ministry of the Methodist New Connexion.\n\nSoon he was barred from campaigning in Methodist congregations, so he became an independent evangelist. His doctrine remained much the same, though; he preached that eternal punishment was the fate of those who do not believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the necessity of repentance from sin, and the promise of holiness. He taught that this belief would manifest itself in a life of love for God and mankind. The Ethical characteristic of William Booth's business ventures was evident in the manufacture of boxes of Salvation Army matches which bore the slogan \"Lights in darkest England, Security from fire, Fair wages for fair work\". His match factory on Old Ford paid 4 pence a gross, while the larger firms only paid 2 1/2 pence.\n\nThe Christian Mission\n\nThe tent was set up on an old Quaker burial ground on Mile End Waste in Whitechapel, with an initial goal to deliver the good news to all.\n\nBy 1865, Booth and his wife Catherine had opened 'The Christian Revival Society' in the East End of London, which held regular evening meetings to share the repentance that Booth believed Christian salvation could bring both the poor and marginalised. The Christian Revival Society was later renamed The Christian Mission, subsequently to become the East London Christian Mission.\nThe Christian Mission's slow growth was hard work for Booth; His wife writes that he would \"stumble home night after night haggard with fatigue, often his clothes were torn and bloody bandages swathed his head where a stone had struck[.]\" \n\nEvening meetings were held in an old warehouse where urchins threw stones and fireworks through the window. Outposts were established throughout the city, attracting converts, but the Christian Mission remained just one of the five hundred charitable groups working in London's East End.\n\nBooth practised various types of charity himself, such as opening \"Food for the Million\" (soup kitchens).\n\nThe Salvation Army\n\nHaving been founded as the East London Christian Mission in 1865, the name The Salvation Army developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, \"We are a volunteer army.\" Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, \"Volunteer, I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \"volunteer\" and substitute the word \"salvation\".(The printer's proof copy of the Missions' report for 1878 declared \"The Christian Mission Is A Volunteer Army\", but the corrected proof read \"The Christian Mission Is ... A Salvation Army\") The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in \"God's Army\" would wear the army's own uniform, 'putting on the armour,' for meetings and ministry work. He became the \"General\" and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as \"officers\". Other members became \"soldiers\".\n\nThough the early years were lean ones, with the need of money to help the needy an ever growing issue, Booth and The Salvation Army persevered. In the early 1880s, operations were extended to other countries, notably the United States, France, Switzerland, Sweden and others, including to most of the countries of the British Empire: Australia, Canada, India, Cape Colony, New Zealand, Jamaica, etc.\n\nOften the beginnings in other countries occurred through \"salvationist\" activities by non-officers who had emigrated. With some initial success they would contact London to 'send officers.'\n\nIn other cases, like in Argentina, a non-salvationist told Booth that there were thousands of British people there who needed salvation. The four officers sent in 1890 found that those British were scattered all over the pampas.",

The estuary stingray, also known as the estuary stingaree or brown stingray, is a species of stingray belonging to the family dasyatidae. It is endemic to eastern australia and typically inhabits shallow, mangrove-lined tidal rivers, estuaries, and bays in southern queensland and new south wales. These rays have a yellow-brown to olive color and can grow up to at least 93 cm (37 inches) across.\n\nThe estuary stingray has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc and a mostly smooth, whip-like tail that bears both dorsal and ventral fin folds. It can be identified by its long, narrow nostrils and the row of thorns along the midline of its back. Although it has gained infamy for consuming farmed shellfish like oysters, it predominantly feeds on crustaceans and polychaete worms.\n\nThe reproductive system of the estuary stingray is aplacental viviparous. Unborn young are sustained to term by maternal histotroph, also known as \"uterine milk.\" this species has likely suffered a decline in population due to a combination of habitat degradation, mortality from commercial and recreational fishing, and persecution by shellfish farmers. The international union for conservation of nature (iucn) has assessed the estuary stingray as vulnerable.\n\nIn terms of taxonomy, the first reference to the estuary stingray in scientific literature was probably a record by 19th-century english naturalist william saville-kent, who noted a \"trygon pastinaca\" feeding on oysters in a queensland estuary. The species was formally described by australian ichthyologist james douglas ogilby in a 1908 volume of proceedings of the royal society of queensland, based on a specimen collected from the brisbane river. The specific epithet fluviorum means \"of the rivers\" in latin. \n\n<user> What's their habitat like, and can they live in fresh water? \n\n<assistant> The habitat of the estuary stingray is quite specific. They are mainly found in tidal rivers, intertidal flats of estuaries, and bays that are lined with mangroves and possess sandy to muddy bottoms. Estuary stingrays prefer sheltered areas and are rarely found outside these environments. Although they have been recorded in offshore waters at depths of up to 28 meters (92 feet), such occurrences are rare.\n\nEstuary stingrays inhabit marine and brackish waters, but there is evidence suggesting that they may be able to tolerate fresh water as well. They have been known to swim upriver beyond the limit of high tide, which could indicate a capacity for freshwater tolerance. Surface water temperatures within their range can vary from 24°c to 29°c (75°f to 84°f) in the north and 17°c to 23°c (63°f to 73°f) in the south.\n\nTheir habitat requirements appear to be quite stringent, as significant numbers are found only at specific locations. As a result, the distribution of the estuary stingray spans approximately 1,700 km (1,100 mi) along australia's eastern coast, from repulse bay in queensland to the hacking river in new south wales. It is most common in southern queensland, including hervey bay and moreton bay. \n\n<user> What's their behavior like, and how do they interact with other marine life, especially their prey? \n\n<assistant> Estuary stingrays display interesting behavior, particularly in terms of how they forage for food and interact with other marine life, especially their prey. Despite their reputation for preying voraciously on oysters and other farmed shellfish, the estuary stingray's diet actually consists mainly of crustaceans and polychaete worms. Soldier crabs (mictyris longicarpus), for instance, are an important prey species for estuary stingrays in moreton bay.\n\nThese rays have been seen entering mudflats with the rising tide to forage for food. They use their sensitive snouts to detect buried prey in the sediments and can efficiently extract them using their strong jaws and specialized mouthparts. Estuary stingrays are capable of feeding on a wide variety of invertebrates, such as crabs, worms, and mollusks. Their small, bow-shaped mouths are surrounded by deep furrows, and they contain a row of five papillae across the floor. The teeth are small and arranged into pavement-like surfaces.\n\nEstuary stingrays seem to segregate by size and sex in their natural habitats. They are known to exhibit size and sex segregation within specific areas, with smaller, younger individuals commonly found in shallower areas, while larger, older individuals tend to inhabit deeper waters. This behavior may be related to predator avoidance, as smaller rays are more vulnerable to predation and may face a higher risk in deeper, more exposed areas.\n\nIn terms of interactions with other marine life, estuary stingrays coexist with various fish species and marine animals in their habitat. As an example, they share tidal rivers, estuaries, and bays along australia's east coast with many fish species, sharks, and other invertebrates. Estuary stingrays are also known to face challenges from human activities, such as commercial and recreational fishing, and shellfish farming.\n\nAs bottom-dwelling animals, estuary stingrays generally have a relatively low impact on their ecosystem. Their feeding habits do not drastically alter the balance of other species in their environment. However, their potential impact on farmed shellfish has been a concern for some shellfish farmers, who may persecute them due to the belief that they are responsible for significant losses in shellfish production.\n\nIt is essential to understand the behavior and ecology of estuary stingrays to design effective conservation measures and ensure their preservation for future generations. The species is currently assessed as vulnerable by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn), facing threats from habitat degradation, fishing mortality, and human persecution. Appropriate management and protection efforts are necessary to secure their long-term survival. ",

It opened in 1895 and was consecrated in 1898. The church is situated on new church road, near st leonard's, the parish church of aldrington. Despite facing the threat of closure, it remains operational as of 2012 and is a grade ii listed building.\n\nThe area experienced rapid residential growth in the mid-19th century, which led to the development and rebuilding of st leonard's church. By 1894, with the merging of aldrington and hove, the population continued to grow, reaching over 2,200 residents. It was decided that a chapel of ease was necessary to serve the population east of st leonard's, so st philip's church was built to fill this need.\n\nThe church's construction was commissioned by the rector of st leonard's, who acquired land from the duke of portland in november 1894. John oldrid scott, son of the renowned architect sir george gilbert scott, was chosen to design the church. The building work took less than a year, and the first service was held on 28 october 1895.

What sets it apart is its impressive use of different building materials that come together in various colors and types, creating intricate patterns on both the interior and exterior.\n\nThe original building and the extension, built between 1909 and 1910, use a combination of knapped flintwork, limestone, bath stone, and red brickwork for visual interest and texture in their design. The extension is perfectly in line with the original building's aesthetic, making it indistinguishable from the older section. \n\n<user> Were there any significant events or additions to the church over the years? \n\n<assistant> Yes, there have been notable events and additions to st philip's church over time. In 1941, an architectural firm named tetley and felce designed and added a porch as an extension to the church. Later in 1956, the west end of the church was converted into a hall. A large 300 square feet mural, representing sussex, was painted on the dividing wall by artist augustus lunn in 1957 and 1958.\n\nA remarkable event took place in the church's centenary year when an episode of the long-running bbc radio program \"any questions?\" was recorded there. On 10th march 1995, the show featured a live debate with the participation of three major political figures - former conservative prime minister sir edward heath, labour minister and sdp founder roy jenkins, and former labour minister gerald kaufman - along with the spectator deputy editor anne applebaum. \n\n<user> Can you summarize st philip's church's importance and key features? \n\n<assistant> St philip's church is a significant church of england parish church in hove, brighton and hove, england.

It was opened in 1895 and consecrated in 1898 on New Church Road, near Aldrington's parish church of St Leonard's. It has come under threat of closure but is still active as of 2012. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nHistory\nThe road now named New Church Road is the old route between the ancient villages of Hove and Aldrington. There was some Roman and Saxon activity at Aldrington, but severe decline set in during the 18th and 19th centuries, such that only one person was living there by 1831. The rapid residential growth of Hove in the mid-19th century stimulated development in Aldrington from around 1850, however, and St Leonard's Church was rebuilt from its ruined state to serve the area. By 1894, Aldrington and Hove had merged, and the population of Aldrington alone exceeded 2,200. It was decided that a chapel of ease was needed to serve the area east of St Leonard's Church. Its rector bought land from the Duke of Portland in November of that year and commissioned Sir George Gilbert Scott's son John Oldrid Scott to design a church.\n\nBuilding work took less than a year: the first service at St Philip's took place on 28 October 1895. The consecration ceremony was not held until 29 May 1898, however. By that date, £5,492.15s.10d (£ in ) had been spent on construction and the land. It was extended at a cost of about £4,000 (£ in ) between 1909 and 1910, at which point the deeds transferring ownership of the land from the Duke of Portland to the rector of St Leonard's Church was found to be invalid. A new arrangement was drawn up and the church became the property of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. In 1912 it gained its own benefice and parish, which still exists as of 2012 and which has had ten vicars since its creation.\n\nAnother extension was added in 1941: architecture firm Tetley and Felce designed and added a porch. The west end of the church was converted into a hall in 1956; a large (300 sq ft) Sussex-themed mural was painted on the dividing wall by the muralist Augustus Lunn in 1957 and 1958. \n\nThe church received national attention in its centenary year when an edition of the long-running BBC Radio programme Any Questions? was recorded there.

Simon de montfort, a baronial rebel leader, initiated the gathering as a way to stabilize his political position and gather more support.\n\nHaving seized power in england after his victory over king henry iii at the battle of lewes during the second barons' war, montfort faced threats to his grip on the country. To consolidate his position, he summoned representatives from not only the barons and the knights of the shires, as seen in previous parliaments, but also from burgesses of the major towns. The parliament met in london and discussed radical reforms.\n\nWhile montfort was killed at the battle of evesham later that year, his idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments grew more popular under the reign of henry's son, edward i. By the 14th century, this became the norm, and the assembly eventually evolved into the house of commons. This parliament is sometimes considered the first english parliament, with montfort often referred to as the founder of the commons.\n\nThe background of this parliament goes back to 1258 when king henry iii of england faced a revolt among the english barons. Growing anger about the king's officials raising funds, the influence of his poitevin relatives at court, and his unpopular sicilian policy led to unrest even within the church. A coup d'état occurred on april 30th, leading to the king agreeing to govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen instead of personal rule.\n\nDespite efforts for reforms such as the provisions of oxford and the provisions of westminster, stability was not restored, and england's situation worsened. In 1263, civil war loomed, and montfort convened a council of rebel barons, leading to him seizing power.\n\nIn the midst of infighting among the barons and the fracturing of montfort's coalition, henry regained some freedom and eventually, civil war broke out in 1264. Montfort was desperate and followed henry's armies, culminating in the battle of lewes. Montfort emerged victorious, forcing henry to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the provisions of oxford.\n\nIt was under these circumstances that simon de montfort's parliament was held in january 1265, an assembly of diverse representatives and a precursor to the house of commons we know today. \n\n<user> How did the provisions of oxford and westminster affect the political situation in england? \n\n<assistant> The provisions of oxford and the provisions of westminster were two sets of legislative measures passed during the political crisis of the mid-13th century in england, aiming to reform governance and limit the abuse of power by the king and the major barons.\n\nThe provisions of oxford, established in 1258, created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons. This council had the power to appoint england's justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer and would be monitored through triennial parliaments. These provisions were intended to limit king henry iii's personal rule and restructure government operations by allowing more influence from the barons.\n\nAs for the provisions of westminster in 1259, they built upon the oxford provisions while introducing more radical measures. These measures tackled various grievances, such as land law reform, appointment of local officials, regulations on inheritance, and jewish money lending, among other issues.\n\nThough both sets of provisions aimed to create a more efficient and fair government, they contributed to further conflicts between various factions in england. Disagreements and the differing interests of barons like montfort, who sought even more radical reforms, resulted in instability and mounting tensions. The unstable political situation ultimately led to the second barons' war and the rise of simon de montfort as a major player in english politics. \n\n<user> What eventually led to the end of the second barons' war? \n\n<assistant> The second barons' war, a conflict between king henry iii and rebel english barons led by simon de montfort, eventually ended after a series of events that weakened and destabilized montfort's position.\n\nSimon de montfort's parliament in 1265 was meant to solidify his power and expand his base of support. Although it temporarily achieved this objective, montfort faced concurrent internal and external challenges that undermined his ability to maintain control.\n\nThe first challenge arose from internal divisions within montfort's coalition. His radical reform agenda alienated some barons who either supported moderate change or opposed any limitations on the king's power. Montfort failed to maintain the cohesiveness of his coalition, breeding dissent and laying the groundwork for his eventual downfall.\n\nExternally, montfort faced continued opposition from major figures, including henry's eldest son, prince edward (later king edward i). Edward managed to escape captivity after the battle of lewes and mobilized supporters against montfort. An important turning point occurred when gilbert de clare, the powerful earl of gloucester, a key supporter of montfort, defected to the royalist side. This defection undermined montfort's military strength and eroded his base of support.\n\nThe decisive event that marked the end of the second barons' war was the battle of evesham on august 4, 1265. Prince edward led the royalist forces against montfort's army in a battle characterized by a fierce and brutal fight. Montfort was significantly outnumbered, and his forces suffered a crushing defeat. Simon de montfort was killed during the battle, and his body was mutilated as a sign of disrespect.\n\nAfter evesham, the remaining rebel barons were gradually subdued by the royalist forces. The official conclusion of the war was the dictum of kenilworth in 1266, which was a royalist settlement offering pardons in exchange for fines. This settlement allowed the country to move past the conflict, and stability was gradually restored under henry iii and later his son, edward i.\n\nIn the aftermath, the montfortian vision of a more inclusive and representative parliament was largely overshadowed by the restoration of royal authority. It wasn't until the 14th century, under edward i's reign, that the idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliament became the norm, leading to the formation of the house of commons. \n\n<user> What was montfort's main occupation before rising to power? \n\n<assistant> Before rising to power, simon de montfort was mainly known as a nobleman and a military leader. He held the title of the earl of leicester, and he was an influential baron who played a crucial role in political events of the time, including the rebellion against king henry iii. ",

        "reference": " = Simon de Montfort 's Parliament = \n\n Simon de Montfort 's Parliament was an English parliament held from 20 January 1265 until mid @-@ March the same year , instigated by Simon de Montfort , a baronial rebel leader . \n\n Simon de Montfort had seized power in England following his victory over Henry III at the Battle of Lewes during the Second Barons ' War , but his grip on the country was under threat . In an attempt to gather more support he summoned representatives from not only the barons and the knights of the shires , as had occurred in previous parliaments , but also burgesses from the major towns . The resulting parliament in London discussed radical reforms and temporarily stabilised Montfort 's political situation . Montfort was killed at the Battle of Evesham later that year , but the idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments became more popular under the reign of Henry 's son Edward I. By the 14th century this had become the norm , with the gathering becoming known as the House of Commons . This parliament is sometimes referred to as the first English parliament and Montfort himself is often termed the founder of the Commons . \n\n = = Background = = \n\n In 1258 , King Henry III of England faced a revolt among the English barons . Anger had grown about the way the King 's officials were raising funds , the influence of his Poitevin relatives at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy ; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King . Within Henry 's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems . On 30 April , Hugh Bigod marched into Westminster in the middle of the King 's parliament , backed by his co @-@ conspirators , including Simon de Montfort , the Earl of Leicester , and carried out a coup d 'état . Henry , fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned , agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen , half chosen by the King and half by the barons . \n\n The pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a parliament met in June . The term \" parliament \" had first appeared in the 1230s and 1240s to describe large gatherings of the royal court , and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout Henry 's reign . They were used to agree upon the raising of taxes which , in the 13th century , were single , one @-@ off levies , typically on movable property , intended to support the King 's normal revenues for particular projects . During Henry 's reign , the counties had begun to send regular delegations to these parliaments , and came to represent a broader cross @-@ section of the community than simply the major barons . \n\n The new parliament passed a set of measures known as the Provisions of Oxford , which Henry swore to uphold . These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members , elected solely by the barons , which then had the power to appoint England 's justiciar , chancellor and treasurer , and which would be monitored through triennial parliaments . Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform , intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King 's officials and the major barons . More radical measures were passed by the new council the next year , in the form of the Provisions of Westminster . \n\n The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident . Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown ; others promoted only moderate change , while the conservative barons expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King 's powers . Over the next four years , neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England , and power swung back and forth between the different factions . By early 1263 , what remained of Henry 's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war . Montfort convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue his radical agenda and by October , England faced a likely civil war . Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt . Montfort took Henry and Queen Eleanor prisoner , and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry 's name , the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own , trusted men . \n\n Montfort 's coalition began to quickly fragment , Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England . Henry appealed to his brother @-@ in @-@ law Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute ; Montfort was initially hostile to this idea , but , as war became more likely again , he decided to agree to French arbitration as well . Initially Montfort 's legal arguments held sway , but in January 1264 , Louis announced the Mise of Amiens , condemning the rebels , upholding the King 's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford . The Second Barons ' War finally broke out in April , when Henry led an army into Montfort 's territories . Becoming desperate , Montfort marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May . Despite their numerical superiority , Henry 's forces were overwhelmed . Captured , Henry was forced to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the Provisions of Oxford , leaving him , as historian Adrian Jobson describes , \" little more than a figurehead \" . \n\n = = Parliament = = \n\n",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I am interested in learning about the dutch language's alphabet and spelling system. can you explain how it works and what makes it unique? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The dutch language uses the latin alphabet, which consists of 26 letters. Their alphabet has five (or six) vowels and 21 (or 20) consonants. One unique aspect of the dutch alphabet is the digraph \"ij,\" which is sometimes treated as a single letter.\n\nThe spelling system in the netherlands is regulated by the spelling act of 15 september 2005, which has a legal basis for determining dutch spelling. It is compulsory for government bodies, educational institutions funded from the public purse, and exams with established legal requirements. However, in other cases, it is merely recommended, not mandatory, to follow the official spelling.\n\nDutch orthography incorporates a system for indicating vowel length, which has evolved through multiple stages since old dutch. The modern dutch spelling system still retains many details from late middle dutch. The distinction between checked and free vowels is an essential aspect of dutch spelling. A checked vowel is followed by a consonant in the same syllable (closed syllable), while a free vowel ends the syllable (open syllable). This distinction can apply to pronunciation or spelling independently.\n\nLoanwords often retain their original spellings, but some adaptations may occur. For example, latin and greek letters are sometimes modified or retained in their original form when incorporated into dutch words. \n\n<user> Can you give me more details about the sound-to-spelling correspondences in Dutch, including those for native and non-native vocabulary? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Dutch uses various letters and letter combinations for different sounds in its native and non-native vocabulary. Remember that dialectal variations and subphonemic distinctions are not always indicated. Here are some examples from native or nativized vocabulary of the dutch language:\n\n1. B: /b/ as in \"boek\" (book)\n2. D: /d/ as in \"deur\" (door)\n3. F: /f/ as in \"fiets\" (bicycle)\n4. G: /ɣ/ as in \"grot\" (cave)\n5. H: /ɦ/ as in \"huis\" (house)\n6. K: /k/ as in \"koek\" (cookie)\n7. L: /l/ as in \"lamp\" (lamp)\n\nFor non-native vocabulary or words with older, obsolete spellings (often maintained in proper names), additional letters and pronunciations are used:\n\n1. C: /k/ as in \"concert\" or /s/ as in \"cijfer\" (number)\n2. Qu: /kw/ as in \"quiz\"\n\nLoanwords tend to keep original spellings unless an adaptation is more fitting, like \"cadeau\" for 'gift' from french. Letters like c, x, and y, or sometimes qu are mostly retained. Greek letters φ and ῥ become f and r, θ mostly becomes th, except in specific cases. \n\nCombinations like '-eon-', '-ion-', '-yon-' from french are usually written with a single 'n', such as \"mayonaise,\" unless a schwa follows (e.g., \"stationnement\").\n\nThe dutch language employs an intricate system of single and double letters to indicate vowel length, which has evolved over time. The distinction between checked and free vowels can affect pronunciation or spelling, resulting in various sound-to-spelling correspondences. \n\n<user> That's interesting. can you share more about how the spelling of dutch words evolved and how the modern rules for checked and free vowels came to be? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! The evolution of dutch spelling can be traced back to old dutch, which had phonemic consonant length and phonemic vowel length without a correspondence between the two. In the transition to early middle dutch, short vowels were lengthened when they appeared in open syllables, and short vowels could only occur in closed syllables. Long consonants in pronunciation acted to close the preceding syllable, and thus any short vowel followed by a long consonant remained short.\n\nEarly middle dutch scribes created a spelling system that indicated vowel length only when necessary, sometimes by writing double vowels or other methods. Open syllables implicitly had long vowels, and long consonants were typically written double, meaning a short vowel was always followed by at least two consonant letters or one consonant at the word's end.\n\nAs middle dutch evolved, the distinction between short and long consonants started to fade, allowing short vowels to appear in open syllables again. Dutch writers began using double consonants to indicate short preceding vowels even when the consonant had not been long before. This change eventually led to the modern dutch spelling system.\n\nModern dutch spelling still has many features from late middle dutch, including the distinction between checked and free vowels, as previously mentioned. This particular distinction is important because a syllable that is checked in pronunciation will always be checked in spelling as well . \n\n<user> Thank you for the information. can you please provide examples to demonstrate how the system of checked and free vowels works with short and long vowels? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The checked and free vowel system helps in indicating whether a vowel is short or long. Here are some examples to demonstrate how this works in dutch:\n\n1. Checked in neither:\nExample: \"la-ten\" (meaning \"to leave\" or \"to let\")\nIn this case, the single vowel \"a\" is followed by only one consonant and is not in the same syllable; therefore, it is a long vowel.\n\n2. Checked in spelling only:\nExample: \"lat-ten\" (meaning \"laths\")\nIn this case, the single vowel \"a\" is followed by two consonants in the spelling, but they are not in the same syllable. The vowel \"a\" is long, based on pronunciation.\n\n3. Checked in both:\nExample: \"lat\" (meaning \"lath\") and \"lat-je\" (meaning \"little lath\")\nIn these cases, the single vowel \"a\" is followed by consonants in the same syllable in both spelling and pronunciation, and thus, it is a short vowel.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how the checked and free vowel system in dutch spelling can help determine the length of the vowels. A single vowel that is checked in neither is always long/tense, while a vowel that is checked in both is always short/lax. This system contributes to the unique characteristics of the dutch language and its spelling rules. ",

        "reference": "Dutch orthography uses the Latin alphabet. The spelling system is issued by government decree and is compulsory for all government documentation and educational establishments.\n\nLegal basis\nIn the Netherlands, the official spelling is regulated by the Spelling Act of 15 September 2005. This came into force on 22 February 2006, replacing the Act on the Spelling of the Dutch Language of 14 February 1947.\n\nThe Spelling Act gives the Committee of Ministers of the Dutch Language Union the authority to determine the spelling of Dutch by ministerial decision. In addition, the law requires that this spelling be followed \"at the governmental bodies, at educational institutions funded from the public purse, as well as at the exams for which legal requirements have been established\". In other cases, it is recommended, but it is not mandatory to follow the official spelling.\n\nThe Decree on the Spelling Regulations 2005 of 2006 contains the annexed spelling rules decided by the Committee of Ministers on 25 April 2005. This decree entered into force on August 1, 2006, replacing the Spelling Decree of June 19, 1996.\n\nIn Flanders, the same spelling rules are currently applied by the Decree of the Flemish Government Establishing the Rules of the Official Spelling and Grammar of the Dutch language of 30 June 2006.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe modern Dutch alphabet consists of the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet and is used for the Dutch language. Five (or six) letters are vowels and 21 (or 20) letters are consonants. The letter E is the most frequently used letter in the Dutch alphabet. The least frequently used letters are Q and X. In some aspects, the digraph IJ behaves as a single letter.\n\nSound to spelling correspondences\nDutch uses the following letters and letter combinations. Note that for simplicity, dialectal variation and subphonemic distinctions are not always indicated. See Dutch phonology for more information.\n\nThe following list shows letters and combinations, along with their pronunciations, found in modern native or nativised vocabulary:\n\nThe following additional letters and pronunciations appear in non-native vocabulary or words using older, obsolete spellings (often conserved in proper names):\n\nLoanwords\n\nLoanwords often keep their original spellings: cadeau  'gift' (from French). The Latin letters c, qu, x and y (from Greek υ) are sometimes adapted to k, kw, ks and i, but mostly c, x and y (more rarely qu) are retained. Greek letters φ and ῥ become f and r, not ph or rh, but θ mostly becomes th (except before a consonant, after f or ch and at the end of words). Combinations -eon-, -ion-, -yon- in loanwords from French are written with a single n (mayonaise) except when a schwa follows (stationnement).\n\nVowel length\n\nVowel length is always indicated but in different ways by using an intricate system of single and double letters.\n\nHistorical overview\nOld Dutch possessed phonemic consonant length in addition to phonemic vowel length, with no correspondence between them. Thus, long vowels could appear in closed syllables, and short vowels could occur in open syllables. In the transition to early Middle Dutch, short vowels were lengthened when they stood in open syllables. Short vowels could now occur only in closed syllables. Consonants could still be long in pronunciation and acted to close the preceding syllable. Therefore, any short vowel that was followed by a long consonant remained short.\n\nThe spelling system used by early Middle Dutch scribes accounted for that by indicating the vowel length only when it was necessary (sometimes by writing a double vowel but also in other ways). As the length was implicit in open syllables, it was not indicated there, and only a single vowel was written. Long consonants were indicated usually by writing the consonant letter double, which meant that a short vowel was always followed by at least two consonant letters or by just one consonant at the end of a word.\n\nLater in Middle Dutch, the distinction between short and long consonants started to disappear. That made it possible for short vowels to appear in open syllables once again. Because there was no longer a phonetic distinction between single and double consonants (they were both pronounced short now), Dutch writers started to use double consonants to indicate that the preceding vowel was short even when the consonant had not been long in the past. That eventually led to the modern Dutch spelling system.\n\nChecked and free vowels\nModern Dutch spelling still retains many of the details of the late Middle Dutch system. The distinction between checked and free vowels is important in Dutch spelling. A checked vowel is one that is followed by a consonant in the same syllable (the syllable is closed) while a free vowel ends the syllable (the syllable is open). This distinction can apply to pronunciation or spelling independently, but a syllable that is checked in pronunciation will always be checked in spelling as well (except in some unassimilated loanwords).\n\n Checked in neither: la-ten  (\"to leave\", \"to let\")\n Checked in spelling only: lat-ten  (\"laths\")\n Checked in both: lat  (\"lath\"), lat-je  (\"little lath\")\n\nA single vowel that is checked in neither is always long/tense. A vowel that is checked in both is always short/lax.",

For the riemann zeta function at even positive integers, the values are closely related to bernoulli numbers. The relationship is given by:\n\nΖ(2n) = (-1)^(n+1) * (2^(2n-1)) * π^(2n) * b_(2n) / (2n)!\n\nHere, n is any positive integer, and b_(2n) corresponds to the bernoulli numbers.\n\nNow, for odd positive integers, there's no general formula like the one for even integers. However, some specific values are known. For example, ζ(3) is called apéry's constant, which plays a role in the electron's gyromagnetic ratio, and ζ(5) appears in planck's law. Some of the odd positive integers have been computed, but there's no closed-form expression like there is for even positive integers. \n\n<user> Thanks, that helps! i am also curious about how the riemann zeta function behaves at 0 and 1. those specific cases? \n\n<assistant> At 0, the Riemann zeta function has a special value:\n\nΖ(0) = -1/2\n\nAt 1, the situation is different because ζ(1) is not finite. Instead, the Riemann zeta function has a pole of the first order at 1. This means that the function behaves like 1/(s-1) near s = 1, and it has the left and right limits:\n\nLim(s->1-) ζ(s) = +∞\nLim(s->1+) ζ(s) = +∞\n\nSince the pole is of the first order, it has a complex residue that can be computed as:\n\nRes(ζ(s), s=1) = 1\n\nThis residue is an important factor when we consider the behavior of the zeta function in the complex plane. The Riemann zeta function is a meromorphic function, meaning it has complex derivatives, except for the simple pole at s = 1.\n\nThe behavior at s = 0 and s = 1 play a significant role in understanding the zeta function's general properties, and further study also involves characterizing its non-trivial zeros, about which the Riemann Hypothesis makes some important statements. \n\n<user> Great explanation! now, i'm interested in learning about the basel problem and its connection to the riemann zeta function. what is the basel problem, and how does it relate to ζ(2)? \n\n<assistant> The basel problem refers to the mathematical question of finding the precise value of the sum of the reciprocals of the square of all natural numbers, i.e., the infinite series:\n\n1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25 + ... + 1/n^2 + ... \n\nThe basel problem is connected to the riemann zeta function because the series above is equal to the zeta function evaluated at s = 2, denoted as ζ(2). In other words,\n\nΖ(2) = 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ...\n\nThe basel problem was named after the swiss city of basel because it was first posed by the swiss mathematician johann bernoulli in 1689.

The story revolves around three apprentice witches: Arusu, Sheila, and Eva, who form the Magical Girl Squad.\n\nArusu, the main protagonist, is cheerful, supportive, and a bit of a tomboy. She loves magic and believes it should only be used to make people happy. Despite being a human, she quickly learns magic and becomes skilled at it. She frees all the fairies, leading to the curse on Sheila and Eva.\n\nSheila is the discipline officer in charge of apprentice witches and initially dislikes Arusu's attitude. She is the most knowledgeable and adept witch of the trio, aiming to become a powerful witch. Her mother abandoned her early in life, making her a perfectionist. Arusu's beliefs eventually cause her to change, and she becomes one of Arusu's closest allies.\n\nEva is a friendly witch with limited power and a friend of both Arusu and Sheila. Throughout the series, they work together to overcome various obstacles, learn important lessons, and develop their magical abilities. \n\n<user> How does arusu end up in the magical realm? \n\n<assistant> Arusu finds herself in the magical realm due to an incident involving the true book of spells gifted to her by her father, jidan. While at school, arusu accidentally falls off the top of the building, and lennon, alongside the true book of spells, transports her to the magical realm. Although she's a human, arusu quickly adapts to the new world and is capable of learning magic. This event initiates her journey with the other apprentice witches, sheila and eva, as they embark on exciting adventures together. \n\n<user> In the series, the grand master of witches punishes sheila and eva with a curse because of arusu setting the fairies free. nature of the curse and its effects on sheila and eva? also, tell me about some of the challenges these characters face in their quest to remove the curse. moreover, i'm interested in their development throughout the series and how their relationships change. \n\n<assistant> Sheila and eva are punished with the curse of eternal youth by the grand master of witches for failing to prevent arusu from setting the fairies free. The curse means they will remain the same age indefinitely. Initially, sheila is primarily focused on recapturing the fairies to remove the curse, particularly for eva's sake.\n\nThroughout the series, their relationships evolve. At first, sheila is annoyed by arusu's pacifist beliefs, considering her a burden. However, as they work together to overcome various challenges, sheila gradually changes her perspective and becomes one of arusu's strongest allies and supporters. They all learn the importance of friendship, trust, and perseverance.\n\nThe trio also embarks on a mission to uncover a traitor among the witches, bringing them closer as a team. Their adventures involve fairies, witches, warlocks, and various magical abilities, which ultimately shape their characters, values, and relationships with each other. \n\n<user> Interesting! can you explain how arusu is unique when it comes to riding her broom, and how her skills from the human realm help her with that? \n\n<assistant> Arusu has a distinct way of riding her broom, which sets her apart from other witches in the magical realm. While other witches traditionally ride brooms by sitting on them and flying, arusu cannot ride the broom in this manner. Instead, she adopts a different approach, leveraging her skills from the human realm to her advantage.\n\nBack in the human realm, arusu was skilled at riding a skateboard. Drawing from this experience, she rides her broom as if it were a skateboard, standing on it while flying. This unique method enables her to overcome her initial inability to mount the broom in the traditional way.\n\nArusu's innovative approach to broom-riding demonstrates her resourcefulness and adaptability, qualities that play a significant role in her character's development throughout the series. By integrating her background and experiences from the human realm with the magical practices of the magical realm, she becomes a more powerful and capable witch.\n\nMoreover, her inventive methods also extend to her learning magic spells. She often finds easier ways to word these spells, which not only helps her but also benefits other witches she trains within the series.\n\nUltimately, this distinctive approach to broom-riding and learning magic showcases arusu's individuality, determination, and quick-thinking, which contribute to her growth and foster strong relationships with her fellow witches, especially sheila and eva.

        "reference": "The Tweeny Witches anime series features an extensive cast of fictional characters created by Studio 4°C. The story is set in a fictional universe in which witches, warlocks, and fairies live.\n\nThe story follows the adventures of three apprentice witches named Arusu, Sheila, and Eva. When Arusu releases all of the fairies, the Grand Master of Witches punished Sheila and Eva for their failure to keep Arusu from setting all of the fairies free.\n\nMagical Girl Squad\n\nArusu\n\n is the main protagonist of the series. She is a cheerful and supportive person. A bit of a tomboy, she means to do well and is not disheartened when others put her down, instead she encourages them. Arusu loves magic (as well as sweet chestnuts) and believes it should only be used to make people happy. Her father, Jidan, gave her the True Book of Spells for her 5th birthday and was the one who taught her that magic should only be used for happiness and never destruction. At the beginning of the season, Lennon and the book brought her to the Magical Realm when she accidentally fell off the top of the school. Despite being a human, she was able to learn magic fairly quickly and is better than some of the native witches in the Magical Realm. She is the one who set all of the fairies free and caused Eva and Sheila to be cursed.  In the end, she decided to go back to the Human Realm with the help of one of the interdimensional sirens where she found her mother talking to her father in the kitchen. She has many noticeable habits: she has long fingernails, both to have more of a witch-like appearance, as well as to make it easier to open up sweet chestnuts, is able to find easier ways to word the magic spells she is taught, which in turn actually helps most of the witches she trains with. She cannot ride a broom the normal witch way, so she rides it like one would a skateboard since she was quite skilled with one back in the Human Realm.\n\nSheila\n\n is the discipline officer in charge of the apprentice witches in district A. The most knowledgeable and adept witch of the trio, she initially disliked Arusu's attitude. The Curse of Eternal Youth was cast on her and Eva for their failure to keep Arusu from setting all of the fairies free. For the first half of the series, she was concentrated on recapturing all the fairies in order to remove the spell (she was mostly concerned with removing the spell from Eva). Sheila is the daughter of a witch and warlock, so according to customs, she must live in the Witch Realm away from her father. Her mother abandoned her early in life to stay with her husband in the Warlock Realm. This hardened her heart and she became a perfectionist, bent on becoming a powerful witch and depending on no one but herself. Arusu's pacifist beliefs annoyed her at first, but had a change of heart later in the season, becoming one of Arusu's strongest allies and supporters. She was later entrusted by the Grand Master of Witches to find the traitor among the witches, the person the warlocks need to cast dark magic. She suspected Barunn, Nerabu, and Biris, unaware that the future traitor is closer to her than she thinks. Though she may seem gruff, Sheila has a good heart.\n\nEva\n\nA friend of both Arusu and Sheila,  is a friendly witch with a small amount of power.",

However, in judaism and protestant christianity, it is not considered canonical and is classified as part of the biblical apocrypha.\n\nThe book is named after baruch ben neriah, jeremiah's scribe, who is presumed to be the author. It is a reflection of a late jewish writer on the circumstances of jewish exiles from babylon and includes meditations on israel's theology and history, discussions of wisdom, and a direct address to residents of jerusalem and the diaspora. Some scholars believe the book was written during or shortly after the maccabean period.\n\nThe book of baruch is part of the septuagint, the eritrean/ethiopian orthodox bible, and theodotion's greek version. However, it is not included in the hebrew bible. Its exclusion from some traditions and inclusion in others led to its classification as a deuterocanonical book.\n\nTo distinguish it from other texts with the same title (2 baruch, 3 baruch, and 4 baruch), it is sometimes referred to as 1 baruch. In some versions, the letter of jeremiah is appended to the end of the book of baruch as a sixth chapter or is considered a separate book. \n\n<user> What might have influenced the author of the book of baruch? \n\n<assistant> The circumstances of the jewish exiles from babylon and their longing for home likely influenced the author of the book of baruch. The content of the book seems to draw from historical events and the challenges faced by the jewish people during their exile. The author focuses on theological reflections, attempts to provide consolation, and encourages the community with hopes for restoration.\n\nSpecifically, the author reflects on israel's history and how the exile resulted from disobedience to god. Through confession of sins, prayers for mercy, and contemplation on wisdom, the author emphasizes the importance of turning back to god and maintaining faith.\n\nAnother possible influence on the book's composition is the maccabean period, which was a time of political and religious struggle in jewish history. Considering the themes of the book, it's likely that the author was influenced by the events, religious fervor, and spiritual aspirations of this era.\n\nIn addition to historical events, the author might also have been influenced by other biblical texts, especially those written by the prophet jeremiah, since the book mentions the connection to jeremiah's scribe, baruch ben neriah. The writer might have sought to connect the concerns and experiences of the displaced jewish people to their broader scriptural tradition. \n\n<user> I am curious about the structure and the main themes of the book of baruch. could you provide more details on those aspects? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The book of baruch has a distinct structure that's organized around specific themes. Here's a breakdown of its basic outline, along with the themes addressed in each section:\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–14): the author introduces the words of baruch written in babylonia, and the people's reaction to it, which involves weeping, fasting, and praying before the lord.\n\n2. Confession of sins (1:15–2:10): this section acknowledges god's justice in bringing hardships upon the people as a result of their disobedience, and admits to not heeding his voice.\n\n3. Prayer for mercy (2:11–3:8): the author pleads for god's mercy, noting that the dead cannot give glory and justice to the lord (this connects to psalms 6:6/5).\n\n4. A paean for wisdom (3:9–4:14): this hymn venerates wisdom and questions the value of earthly treasures that people trust, emphasizing the eventual downfall of those who hoard material wealth.\n\n5. Baruch's poem of consolation (4:5–5:9): this poem contains messages for those in captivity, \"neighbors of zion,\" and jerusalem. It explains that the people have been sold to gentiles, not for destruction, but as a consequence of provoking god's wrath. Throughout the poem, themes of hope, restoration, and faith are conveyed.\n\nThe book of baruch's main themes include confession, prayer for mercy, wisdom, hope, consolation, and faith in god. It serves to connect the past and present experiences of the jewish people and emphasizes the importance of returning to god and keeping the faith during challenging times. ",

In 80-book Protestant Bibles, the Book of Baruch is a part of the Biblical apocrypha. Jerome excluded both the Book of Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah from the Vulgate Bible, but both works were introduced into Latin Vulgate Bibles sporadically from the 9th century onwards; and were incorporated into the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate edition.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I have a fever that's been lasting for weeks, and my doctor hasn't been able to identify the cause. fever of unknown origin and its possible causes? \n\n<assistant> I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. Fever of unknown origin (fuo) refers to a condition where a patient has an elevated temperature, but the cause remains unknown despite thorough investigation by a physician. It typically meets these criteria:\n- fever higher than 38.3°c (101°f) on several occasions\n- persisting without diagnosis for at least 3 weeks\n- at least 1 week's investigation in the hospital or equivalent outpatient investigation\n\nFuo can be caused by various factors, including infections, neoplasms, noninfectious inflammatory diseases, miscellaneous conditions, inherited and metabolic diseases, and thermoregulatory disorders. Some of the most frequent causes of fuo are extrapulmonary tuberculosis and lymphomas. Other potential causes include drug-induced hyperthermia, disseminated granulomatoses, thromboembolic disease, endocarditis, and bartonella infections.\n\nThe diagnostic process for fuo can be quite complex, involving a comprehensive history-taking, repeated physical examinations, and numerous laboratory tests like serological tests and blood cultures. Imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, echocardiography, ct scans, and positron emission tomography (pet scans), may also be employed to help localize the source of the fever.\n\nEven with all these efforts, the cause of the fever might only be suggested by the therapy that works. For example, if a patient recovers after discontinuing medication, it could be drug fever, while recovery after antibiotics or antimycotics might suggest an infection. Empirical therapeutic trials can be used if other techniques fail to identify the cause. \n\n<user> It's quite a long list of possible causes. can you provide more information about the four subclasses of fuo and how they're differentiated? \n\n<assistant> Certainly. The four subclasses of fever of unknown origin (fuo) are:\n\n1. Classic fuo:\nThis category refers to the original definition by petersdorf and beeson. Conditions in this classification are generally divided into five categories: infections (e.g., abscesses, endocarditis, tuberculosis, complicated urinary tract infections), neoplasms (e.g., lymphomas, leukemias), connective tissue diseases (e.g., temporal arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, still's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), miscellaneous disorders (e.g., alcoholic hepatitis, granulomatous conditions), and undiagnosed conditions.\n\n2. Nosocomial fuo:\nNosocomial fuo refers to fever that develops in patients who have been admitted to the hospital for at least 24 hours. This type of fever is commonly associated with hospital-related factors such as surgery, use of urinary catheters, intravascular devices, drugs (e.g., antibiotic-induced clostridium difficile colitis, drug fever), and/or immobilization (e.g., decubitus ulcers). Other conditions to consider include sinusitis in the icu, deep-vein thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, transfusion reactions, acalculous cholecystitis, thyroiditis, alcohol/drug withdrawal, adrenal insufficiency, and pancreatitis.\n\n3. Immune-deficient fuo:\nThis type of fuo is seen in patients with compromised immune systems, such as those receiving chemotherapy or those with hematologic malignancies. Fever in these cases may be accompanied by neutropenia (neutrophil count <500/ul) or impaired cell-mediated immunity. The lack of immune response makes it harder to identify the cause, but infection is the most common cause in this subclass.\n\n4. Human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-associated fuo:\nHiv-infected patients form a separate subgroup of immune-deficient fuo. These patients frequently experience fever, especially during the primary phase of the infection, as it presents with a mononucleosis-like illness.\n\nThe differentiation of these subclasses can help narrow down the list of potential causes, guide further investigations, and tailor an appropriate management plan for the patient. \n\n<user> What steps should i take if i suspect i have fever of unknown origin? what should i expect from healthcare professionals in terms of diagnosis and possible treatments? \n\n<assistant> If you suspect you have a fever of unknown origin (fuo), the first step is to consult your healthcare provider. They will conduct a detailed evaluation of your medical history, any recent travel, medications, and possible exposures to infections. Repeated physical examinations will be performed to look for skin rashes, eschars, lymphadenopathy, heart murmurs, or other relevant signs.\n\nYour healthcare provider may order several laboratory tests, such as serological tests and blood cultures, to help identify potential causes. Imaging studies like ultrasounds, echocardiograms, ct scans, or pet scans may also be required in some cases, depending on the initial findings.\n\nThe diagnosis and treatment process for fuo can be challenging and may require trials of different therapies to identify the underlying cause. Your healthcare professional may consult with specialists or recommend testing and treatment based on the most probable causes.\n\nIn some cases, empirical therapeutic trials might be used if other diagnostic techniques have failed. This means that your doctor might prescribe a treatment based on the most likely cause, and if you respond to the treatment, it serves as an indication that this was indeed the cause of the fever.\n\nThroughout the process, it's essential to maintain open communication with your healthcare provider, report any changes in your symptoms or new developments, and be prepared for the possibility that identifying the cause of your fever may take time. \n\n<user> Are there any measures i can take to prevent getting a fever of unknown origin? \n\n<assistant> While it's not always possible to prevent a fever of unknown origin (FUO) due to the diverse and sometimes elusive causes, there are general measures you can take to maintain good health and reduce the risk of infections or complications that may lead to a fever:\n\n1. Practice good hygiene: Washing your hands regularly with soap and water, especially before preparing or eating food, after using the restroom or being in public spaces, can help minimize exposure to pathogens.\n\n2. Get vaccinated: Ensure you're up-to-date with recommended vaccinations, which can help protect against various infections that may cause fever.\n\n3. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, staying hydrated, and getting adequate sleep can help support your immune system's ability to fight off illnesses.\n\n4. Be cautious when traveling: Be aware of health risks in areas you're traveling to, and follow local guidelines to minimize your risk of exposure to infections.\n\n5. Manage chronic conditions: If you have any chronic medical conditions, work closely with your healthcare provider to manage them effectively, reducing the risk of complications that may lead to FUO.\n\n6. Avoid risky behaviors: Practice safe sex, avoid sharing needles or participating in activities that may expose you to infections or cause harm to your body.\n\nIt's important to remember that although these measures can help reduce the risk of developing a fever, they may not guarantee complete protection against FUO due to the complexity and diversity of its potential causes. If you experience a persistent fever that eludes diagnosis, consult your healthcare provider for further evaluation and management. ",

Ultrasound may show cholelithiasis, echocardiography may be needed in suspected endocarditis and a CT-scan may show infection or malignancy of internal organs. Another technique is Gallium-67 scanning which seems to visualize chronic infections more effectively. Invasive techniques (biopsy and laparotomy for pathological and bacteriological examination) may be required before a definite diagnosis is possible.\n\nPositron emission tomography using radioactively labelled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been reported to have a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 86% for localizing the source of fever of unknown origin.\n\nDespite all this, diagnosis may only be suggested by the therapy chosen. When a patient recovers after discontinuing medication it likely was drug fever, when antibiotics or antimycotics work it probably was infection. Empirical therapeutic trials should be used in those patients in which other techniques have failed.\n\nDefinition\nIn 1961 Petersdorf and Beeson suggested the following criteria:\n Fever higher than 38.3 °C (101 °F) on several occasions\n Persisting without diagnosis for at least 3 weeks\n At least 1 week's investigation in hospital\n\nA new definition which includes the outpatient setting (which reflects current medical practice) is broader, stipulating:\n 3 outpatient visits or\n 3 days in the hospital without elucidation of a cause or\n 1 week of \"intelligent and invasive\" ambulatory investigation.\n\nPresently FUO cases are codified in four subclasses.\n\nClassic FUO\nThis refers to the original classification by Petersdorf and Beeson. Studies show there are five categories of conditions:\n infections (e.g.  abscesses, endocarditis, tuberculosis, and complicated urinary tract infections),\n neoplasms (e.g. lymphomas, leukaemias),\n connective tissue diseases (e.g. temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica, Still's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis),\n miscellaneous disorders (e.g.  alcoholic hepatitis, granulomatous conditions), and\n undiagnosed conditions.\n\nNosocomial\nNosocomial FUO refers to pyrexia in patients that have been admitted to hospital for at least 24 hours. This is commonly related to hospital-associated factors such as surgery, use of a urinary catheter, intravascular devices (i.e. \"drip\", pulmonary artery catheter), drugs (antibiotic-induced Clostridium difficile colitis, drug fever), and/or immobilization (decubitus ulcers). Sinusitis in the intensive care unit is associated with nasogastric and orotracheal tubes. Other conditions that should be considered are deep-vein thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, transfusion reactions, acalculous cholecystitis, thyroiditis, alcohol/drug withdrawal, adrenal insufficiency, and pancreatitis.\n\nImmune-deficient\nImmunodeficiency can be seen in patients receiving chemotherapy or in hematologic malignancies. Fever is concomitant with neutropenia (neutrophil <500/uL) or impaired cell-mediated immunity. The lack of immune response masks a potentially dangerous course. Infection is the most common cause.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated\n\nHIV-infected patients are a subgroup of the immunodeficient FUO, and frequently have fever. The primary phase shows fever since it has a mononucleosis-like illness.",

It is essentially an \"iou\" and carries a fixed maturity of rarely more than 270 days.\n\nBeing not backed by collateral, only firms with excellent credit ratings can sell their commercial paper at a reasonable price. It is usually sold at a discount from face value and generally has lower interest repayment rates than bonds due to shorter maturities. The longer the maturity on a note, the higher the interest rate the issuing institution pays.\n\nCommercial paper is used to fund operating expenses or current assets rather than financing fixed assets like land, buildings, or machinery. As it qualifies under specific criteria, it does not need to be registered with the u.s. Securities and exchange commission. It is primarily a money-market security and forms part of a continuous rolling program, either a number of years long in europe or open-ended in the united states. \n\n<user> How does the issuance of commercial paper affect the economy and businesses? \n\n<assistant> The issuance of commercial paper can have several effects on the economy and businesses. For businesses, commercial paper provides a cost-effective way to raise short-term funds without relying on traditional bank loans. This helps companies manage their cash flow, finance daily operations, and cover short-term liabilities. Additionally, since commercial paper is issued by large corporations with excellent credit ratings, it provides investors an opportunity to invest in low-risk, short-term securities with potentially better returns than savings accounts or other low-risk investments.\n\nFor the economy, the commercial paper market can play a crucial role in promoting liquidity, as it offers a source of short-term funds for businesses, helping them maintain their operations and manage fluctuating cash flow needs. Moreover, a healthy commercial paper market reflects investors' confidence in the creditworthiness of the issuing corporations, which can boost economic growth. However, any disruption in the commercial paper market, such as a decline in the creditworthiness of issuers or a lack of investor confidence, can lead to decreased liquidity and potentially pose risks to the broader financial system. \n\n<user> Can you share some history and stats on how the commercial paper market has evolved over time? \n\n<assistant> Commercial credit, in the form of promissory notes issued by corporations, can be traced back to at least the 19th century. Marcus goldman, the founder of goldman sachs, started trading commercial paper in new york in 1869.\n\nOver the years, the commercial paper market has grown significantly. At the end of 2009, more than 1,700 companies in the united states issued commercial paper. As of october 31, 2008, the u.s. Federal reserve reported seasonally adjusted figures for the end of 2007, which showed $1.7807 trillion in total outstanding commercial paper. Out of this, $801.3 billion was \"asset-backed\" and $979.4 billion was not; $162.7 billion of the latter was issued by non-financial corporations, and $816.7 billion was issued by financial corporations.\n\nOutside the united states, the international euro-commercial paper market has also evolved, with over $500 billion in outstandings as of the provided information, with instruments denominated predominantly in euros, dollars, and sterling. \n\n<user> With so many options in the financial market like bonds and stocks, why would investors prefer commercial paper? what are potential risks they should be aware of? \n\n<assistant> Investors may prefer commercial paper over other options in the financial market for several reasons:\n\n1. Short-term investment: commercial paper offers a low-risk, short-term investment alternative, making it suitable for investors looking to park their funds for a short period without being committed to longer-term assets.\n\n2. Competitive returns: commercial paper generally offers better returns than other short-term, low-risk investments like savings accounts or certificates of deposit.\n\n3. High credit quality: issued by corporations with high credit ratings, commercial paper typically carries less credit risk compared to investments with lower-rated issuers.\n\n4. Diversification: commercial paper can be a valuable component of an investor's portfolio, allowing for diversification and exposure to different segments of the credit market.\n\nDespite these advantages, investors should be aware of potential risks:\n\n1. Credit risk: commercial paper is not backed by collateral, so the possibility of default still exists. Investors need to evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuer to mitigate this risk.\n\n2. Liquidity risk: although the commercial paper market is generally liquid, instances where investor confidence declines or credit quality deteriorates can lead to reduced liquidity, making it harder to sell the commercial paper at favorable prices.\n\n3. Interest rate risk: changes in market interest rates can affect the returns from commercial paper investments. If interest rates rise, the value of existing commercial paper may decline as newer investments offer higher returns.\n\n4. Limited protections: commercial paper is not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) or any other government agency, meaning investors bear the credit risk without government protections.\n\nBy understanding and managing these risks, investors can optimize the role of commercial paper in their investment portfolios.

Their conductivity and color-changing abilities primarily result from the delocalization of electrons along the polymer backbone, which relies on the overlap of the π-orbitals of the aromatic rings, requiring the thiophene rings to be coplanar.\n\nThe process of achieving conductivity involves oxidation, also known as \"doping.\" when pts are treated with oxidizing agents (electron-acceptors), they become darker in color and electrically conductive as the redox reaction occurs, leading to the formation of a salt.

Sensors: due to their ability to change color and conductivity in response to environmental stimuli such as solvent, temperature, applied potential, and binding to other molecules, pts can be used as sensors that provide a range of optical and electronic responses.\n\n2. Conductive films and coatings: pts can be used in conductive films for antistatic and electromagnetic interference (emi) shielding purposes in various industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, and aerospace.\n\n3. Organic solar cells: pts can be applied in the development of organic solar cells due to their ability to absorb light and generate charge carriers, contributing to higher energy conversion efficiencies.\n\n4. Light-emitting diodes (leds): conjugated polymers like pts have been researched for use in organic light-emitting diodes (oleds), which boast advantages such as flexibility and lower manufacturing costs compared to conventional leds. \n\n<user> That's fascinating! how can these polymers be doped using oxidizing agents? \n\n<assistant> Doping polythiophenes (pts) with oxidizing agents involves a process wherein the oxidant reacts with the pts, resulting in the formation of a conductive salt. Many different oxidants can be used to dope pts, including organic acids, halogens (iodine and bromine), and metal compounds like ferric chloride.\n\nWhen doped, pts undergo a redox reaction with the oxidant. An idealized stoichiometry of this reaction using the oxidant [a]pf6 can be represented as follows:\n\n(c4h2s)n  + 1/5n [a]pf6  →   (c4h2s)n(pf6)0.2n  +  1/5 na\n\nIn this reaction, about 0.2 equivalents of the oxidant are used to convert pts into their optimally conductive state – approximately one of every five rings is oxidized. As the pt becomes oxidized or \"p-doped,\" a bipolaron is formed, with the charged unit moving along the polymer chain, enabling its macroscopic conductivity.\n\nThe choice of oxidant depends on factors such as desired conductivity, environmental stability, and manufacturing considerations. For instance, iodine and bromine dopants can produce highly conductive materials but have lower environmental stability due to the slow evaporation of the halogen. In contrast, organic acids and ferric chloride dopants lead to pts with lower conductivities but higher stability. \n\n<user> Thank you for the detailed explanation. optical properties of polythiophenes and which factors affect their absorption and fluorescence spectra? \n\n<assistant> The optical properties of polythiophenes (pts) are primarily attributed to the extended π-systems in their conjugated backbones, resulting from the overlap of the π-orbitals of the aromatic rings. The key factor that affects the optical properties (absorption and fluorescence spectra) is the conjugation length, which requires the thiophene rings to be coplanar.\n\nThe conjugation length has a direct influence on both the absorption and fluorescence spectra of pts, as it determines the energy levels of the electronic states in these materials. As the conjugation length increases, the energy differences between these states decrease, leading to lower energy, longer wavelength absorptions, and emissions in the composite material.\n\nIn simple terms, conjugation can be viewed as an \"electron-in-a-box\" solution to the schrödinger equation. It is important to note, however, that this is an approximation, and refined models to accurately predict the absorption and fluorescence spectra of well-defined oligo(thiophene) systems are still under development.\n\nTo summarize, the optical properties of polythiophenes, such as absorption and fluorescence spectra, are strongly influenced by the conjugation length in the polymer's structure. The degree of coplanarity, which affects the conjugation length, plays a crucial role in determining the energy levels and spectra of these materials. ",

        "reference": "Polythiophenes (PTs) are polymerized thiophenes, a sulfur heterocycle. The parent PT is an insoluble colored solid with the formula (C4H2S)n.  The rings are linked through the 2- and 5-positions.  Poly(alkylthiophene)s have alkyl substituents at the 3- or 4-position(s).  They are also colored solids, but tend to be soluble in organic solvents.\n\nPTs become conductive when oxidized.  The electrical conductivity results from the delocalization of electrons along the polymer backbone. Conductivity however is not the only interesting property resulting from electron delocalization. The optical properties of these materials respond to environmental stimuli, with dramatic color shifts in response to changes in solvent, temperature, applied potential, and binding to other molecules. Changes in both color and conductivity are induced by the same mechanism, twisting of the polymer backbone and disrupting conjugation, making conjugated polymers attractive as sensors that can provide a range of optical and electronic responses.\n\nThe development of polythiophenes and related conductive organic polymers was recognized by the awarding of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid, and Hideki Shirakawa \"for the discovery and development of conductive polymers\".\n\nMechanism of conductivity and doping\nPT is an ordinary organic polymer, being a red solid that is poorly soluble in most solvents. Upon treatment with oxidizing agents (electron-acceptors) however, the material takes on a dark color and becomes electrically conductive.  Oxidation is referred to as \"doping\".  Around 0.2 equivalent of oxidant is used to convert PTs (and other conducting polymers) into the optimally conductive state.  Thus about one of every five rings is oxidized.  Many different oxidants are used.  Because of the redox reaction, the conductive form of polythiophene is a salt.  An idealized stoichiometry is shown using the oxidant [A]PF6:\n(C4H2S)n  + 1/5n [A]PF6  →   (C4H2S)n(PF6)0.2n  +  1/5 nA\nIn principle, PT can be n-doped using reducing agents, but this approach is rarely practiced.\n\nUpon \"p-doping\", charged unit called a bipolaron is formed. The bipolaron moves as a unit along the polymer chain and is responsible for the macroscopically observed conductivity of the material. Conductivity can approach 1000 S/cm. In comparison, the conductivity of copper is approximately 5×105 S/cm. Generally, the conductivity of PTs is lower than 1000 S/cm, but high conductivity is not necessary for many applications, e.g. as an antistatic film.\n\nOxidants\nA variety of reagents have been used to dope PTs. Iodine and bromine produce highly conductive materials, which are unstable owing to slow evaporation of the halogen. Organic acids, including trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, and sulfonic acids produce PTs with lower conductivities than iodine, but with higher environmental stabilities. Oxidative polymerization with ferric chloride can result in doping by residual catalyst, although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) studies have shown that poly(3-hexylthiophene)s are also partially halogenated by the residual oxidizing agent. Poly(3-octylthiophene) dissolved in toluene can be doped by solutions of ferric chloride hexahydrate dissolved in acetonitrile, and can be cast into films with conductivities reaching 1 S/cm. Other, less common p-dopants include gold trichloride and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.\n\nStructure and optical properties\n\nConjugation length\nThe extended π-systems of conjugated PTs produce some of the most interesting properties of these materials—their optical properties. As an approximation, the conjugated backbone can be considered as a real-world example of the \"electron-in-a-box\" solution to the Schrödinger equation; however, the development of refined models to accurately predict absorption and fluorescence spectra of well-defined oligo(thiophene) systems is ongoing.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Economic philosophy of georgism and its main principles? \n\n<assistant> Georgism, inspired by the american political economist and journalist henry george, is an economic philosophy which advocates that people should own the value they produce themselves, while the economic value derived from land, including natural resources, should be equally distributed among all members of society. It is based on the belief that land and its resources are common goods, and that access to these resources should not be exclusive or lead to inequality.\n\nA key concept in georgism is the implementation of a single tax on land values, also called land value tax (lvt). This tax would replace other taxes, particularly those on income and capital gains. Proponents of georgism argue that the lvt would promote a more productive and just society by reducing wealth disparities and eliminating land speculation.\n\nBy taxing land value and not the improvements made upon it, georgism encourages efficient land use and discourages unproductive land hoarding. This, in turn, fosters economic growth, improves urban planning, and mitigates some of the negative effects of land speculation. Additionally, georgism contends that public revenue generated through lvt can be used to fund essential services and infrastructure projects, further benefiting society as a whole.\n\nOverall, georgism's main principles focus on promoting economic justice, reducing wealth inequality, and ensuring that everyone has the right to benefit from the value of land and natural resources. \n\n<user> Can you provide more insight into henry george's background and how it might have influenced his beliefs and ideas presented in his works, particularly in \"progress and poverty\"? \n\n<assistant> Henry george was born into a lower-middle-class family in philadelphia as the second of ten children. His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout episcopalian. George's early education took place at the episcopal academy in philadelphia, but he didn't complete his studies. Instead, he chose to have a private tutor and supplemented his education by reading avidly and attending lectures at the franklin institute. His formal education ended at age 14, after which he went to sea and later worked as a typesetter in san francisco.\n\nGeorge's personal experiences and observations during his life played a crucial role in shaping his economic beliefs and ideas. In san francisco, he witnessed the harsh realities of poverty, wealth disparity, and the manipulation of resources by powerful interest groups like railroads and land speculators. These observations, combined with his own struggles and near-starvation, fueled his passion for understanding and addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality.\n\nWhen he wrote \"progress and poverty\" in 1879, george sought to investigate the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty in the midst of economic and technological advancement. The book analyzes the cyclic nature of industrialized economies and explores the use of rent capture, such as land value tax and other anti-monopoly reforms, as potential remedies for social problems. His background, hardships, and experiences provided a solid foundation for his thoughts and contributed to his conviction that economic reform was necessary to achieve a more just and equitable society. \n\n<user> How were henry george's ideas received during his lifetime, and what influence did they have on politicians and reform movements? \n\n<assistant> During his lifetime, henry george's ideas gained significant popularity both in the united states and across other anglophone countries. His most famous work, \"progress and poverty,\" sold millions of copies worldwide and established him as a prominent economic thinker of his time. His writings and speeches garnered the attention of the masses and sparked several reform movements of the progressive era.\n\nGeorge's economic philosophy, georgism, influenced politicians, organizations, and political leaders in the united states and abroad. His ideas on land value taxation and other anti-monopoly reforms were embraced by several political parties, like the united labor party and the jefferson democracy party. In fact, george himself ran for the office of mayor of new york city in 1886 and 1897 as a candidate for these parties, receiving 31% and 4% of the votes, respectively.\n\nAlthough george's ideas did not achieve widespread implementation during his lifetime, they continued to inspire and influence later generations of reformers and politicians who sought to address issues of wealth inequality and economic justice. Henry george's advocacy for land value taxation, free trade, the secret ballot, and public ownership of certain natural monopolies left a lasting impact on economic thought and public policy, fostering discussions and debates on these topics that persist even today.\n\nAfter george's death, his legacy was carried forward by organizations and leaders who were committed to the principles of georgism. It's worth noting that george soule, a mid-20th century labor economist and journalist, referred to henry george as \"the most famous american economic writer\" and highlighted the tremendous global reach of his works. \n\n<user> Apart from \"progress and poverty,\" what other works did henry george write, and what are their main concepts? \n\n<assistant> In addition to \"progress and poverty,\" henry george authored several other works that expanded on his economic philosophy and explored various topics of interest. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n1. \"our land and land policy\" (1871): this book, written prior to \"progress and poverty,\" outlined george's initial thoughts on land policy and land value taxation.\n\n2. \"social problems\" (1883): in this work, george delved into various social issues facing the united states during his time, emphasizing the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources to address these challenges.\n\n3. \"protection or free trade\" (1886): this book offered a thorough examination of the debate between protectionism and free trade. George advocated for free trade as a policy that would better serve the interests of society and promote justice and economic growth.\n\n4. \"the condition of labor\" (1891): george responded to pope leo xiii's encyclical \"rerum novarum\" with this open letter, defending his land value tax proposal and further discussing labor and social issues.\n\n5. \"a perplexed philosopher\" (1892): in this book, george critiqued the economic theories of herbert spencer, a prominent philosopher and sociologist of the 19th century. He aimed to highlight inconsistencies within spencer's ideas and defend the principles of georgism.\n\n6. \"the science of political economy\" (1898): published posthumously, this work was george's attempt to provide a comprehensive and systematic treatise on political economy, encapsulating his life's work and economic thought.\n\nThese works reflect george's commitment to addressing social and economic issues, as well as his dedication to spreading the principles of georgism throughout multiple areas of public policy and debate. His persistent advocacy for land value taxation, free trade, and social reforms earned him recognition as a key figure in the history of economic thought. ",

Other works by George defended free trade, the secret ballot, and public ownership of certain natural monopolies.\n\nA journalist for many years, the popularity of his writing and speeches brought him to run for election as Mayor of New York City in 1886 as the United Labor Party nominee and in 1897 as the Jefferson Democracy Party nominee, receiving 31 percent and 4 percent of the vote respectively and finishing ahead of former New York State Assembly Minority Leader Theodore Roosevelt in the first race. After his death during the second campaign, his ideas were carried forward by organizations and political leaders through the United States and other Anglophone countries. The mid-20th century labor economist and journalist George Soule wrote that George was by far \"the most famous American economic writer\" and \"author of a book which probably had a larger world-wide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nGeorge was born in Philadelphia to a lower-middle-class family, the second of ten children of Richard S. H. George and Catharine Pratt George (née Vallance). His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout Episcopalian, and he sent George to the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia. George chafed at his religious upbringing and left the academy without graduating. Instead he convinced his father to hire a tutor and supplemented this with avid reading and attending lectures at the Franklin Institute. His formal education ended at age 14, and he went to sea as a foremast boy at age 15 in April 1855 on the Hindoo, bound for Melbourne and Calcutta. He ended up in the American West in 1858 and briefly considered prospecting for gold but instead started work the same year in San Francisco as a type setter.\n\nIn California, George fell in love with Annie Corsina Fox from Sydney, Australia. They met on her seventeenth birthday on October 12, 1860. She had been orphaned and was living with an uncle. The uncle, a prosperous, strong-minded man, was opposed to his niece's impoverished suitor. But the couple, defying him, eloped and married on December 3, 1861, with Henry dressed in a borrowed suit and Annie bringing only a packet of books.\n\nThe marriage was a happy one, and four children were born to them. On November 3, 1862 Annie gave birth to future United States Representative from New York, Henry George Jr. (1862–1916). Early on, even with the birth of future sculptor Richard F. George (1865–1912), the family was near starvation. George's other two children were both daughters. The first was Jennie George, (c. 1867–1897), later to become Jennie George Atkinson. George's other daughter was Anna Angela George (1878-1947), who would become mother of both future dancer and choreographer, Agnes de Mille and future actress Peggy George, who was born Margaret George de Mille.\n\nFollowing the birth of his second child George had no work and no money and had to beg for food. As he approached the first well-dressed stranger he saw in the street, George, normally a lawful man, decided to rob him if he was unwilling to help. Fortunately, the man took pity on him and gave him five dollars.\n\nGeorge was raised as an Episcopalian, but he believed in \"deistic humanitarianism\". His wife Annie was Irish Catholic, but Henry George Jr. wrote that the children were mainly influenced by Henry George's deism and humanism.\n\nCareer in journalism \n\nAfter deciding against gold mining in British Columbia, George was hired as a printer for the newly created San Francisco Times. He was able to immediately submit editorials for publication, including the popular What the Railroads Will Bring Us, which remained required reading in California schools for decades.  George climbed the ranks of the Times, eventually becoming managing editor in the summer of 1867.  George worked for several papers, including four years (1871–1875) as editor of his own newspaper, the San Francisco Daily Evening Post, and for a time running the Reporter, a Democratic anti-monopoly publication.  George experienced four tough years of trying to keep his newspaper afloat and was eventually forced to go to the streets to beg. The George family struggled, but George's improving reputation and involvement in the newspaper industry lifted them from poverty.\n\nPolitical and economic philosophy\nGeorge began as a Lincoln Republican, but then became a Democrat. He was a strong critic of railroad and mining interests, corrupt politicians, land speculators, and labor contractors. He first articulated his views in an 1868 article entitled \"What the Railroad Will Bring Us.\" George argued that the boom in railroad construction would benefit only the lucky few who owned interests in the railroads and other related enterprises, while throwing the greater part of the population into abject poverty. This had led to him earning the enmity of the Central Pacific Railroad's executives, who helped defeat his bid for election to the California State Assembly.\n\nOne day in 1871 George went for a horseback ride and stopped to rest while overlooking San Francisco Bay. He later wrote of the revelation that he had:\n\nFurthermore, on a visit to New York City, he was struck by the apparent paradox that the poor in that long-established city were much worse off than the poor in less developed California. These observations supplied the theme and title for his 1879 book Progress and Poverty, which was a great success, selling over three million copies.",

They are typically characterized by obvious tumors or swellings. These conditions are similar in nature, with the main difference being their location: proliferative fasciitis occurs in subcutaneous tissues, while proliferative myositis occurs in muscle tissues. \n\nIn 2020, the world health organization grouped these disorders as virtually identical and referred to them as proliferative fasciitis/proliferative myositis or proliferative fasciitis and proliferative myositis. They have been classified as fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors. Although initially regarded as a tissue's self-limiting reaction to injury or other insult, recent studies found common genetic abnormalities in some of the cells in most pf/pm tumors, suggesting they may be classified as \"transient neoplasms.\" despite this, they are benign and do not metastasize. \n\n<user> What age group and gender are most commonly affected by these conditions? \n\n<assistant> Proliferative fasciitis and proliferative myositis primarily affect middle-aged and older adults, with the peak age of onset being between 50 and 55 years old. There is no significant difference in incidence between males and females. Cases in children and adolescents are extremely rare. In roughly 20% to 30% of cases, the lesions are preceded by some sort of mechanical injury. The conditions can present as rapidly growing masses or swellings in the subcutaneous tissues or muscles of an extremity, or less commonly, in the trunk wall, head, or neck areas. \n\n<user> What is the correct approach to treating these lesions, and are there any risks of misdiagnosis? \n\n<assistant> The correct approach to treating pf/pm lesions primarily involves conservative and supportive measures, as these lesions are typically self-limiting and often regress over time. However, due to their alarming growth rates, abnormal histopathologies, and other elements suggestive of malignancy, misdiagnosis is a risk. Pf/pm lesions have occasionally been mistaken for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (also known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma), rhabdomyosarcoma, or other types of sarcoma.\n\nThis misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary aggressive treatments such as wide surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, which can have significant side effects and potential complications. It is important for healthcare professionals to accurately diagnose pf/pm lesions and choose the appropriate conservative and supportive treatment measures to minimize the risk of harm associated with unnecessary aggressive therapies.

        "reference": "Proliferative fasciitis and proliferative myositis (PF/PM) are rare benign soft tissue lesions (i.e. a damaged or unspecified abnormal change in a tissue) that increase in size over several weeks and often regress over the ensuing 1–3 months. The lesions in PF/PM are typically obvious tumors or swellings. Historically, many studies had grouped the two descriptive forms of PF/PM as similar disorders with the exception that proliferative fasciitis occurs in subcutaneous tissues while proliferative myositis occurs in muscle tissues. In 2020, the World Health Organization agreed with this view and defined these lesions as virtually identical disorders termed proliferative fasciitis/proliferative myositis or proliferative fasciitis and proliferative myositis. The Organization also classified them as one of the various forms of the fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors.\n\nPF/PM lesions have been regarded as a tissue's self-limiting reaction to an injury or unidentified insult rather than an abnormal growth of a clone of neoplastic cells, that is, as a group of cells which share a common ancestry, have similar abnormalities in the expression and/or content of their genetic material, and often grow in a continuous and unrestrained manner. However, a recent study has found a common genetic abnormality in some of the cells in most PF/FM tumors. This suggests that PF/PM are, in at least most cases, neoplastic but nonetheless self-limiting and/or spontaneously reversing disorders. That is, they are examples of \"transient neoplasms.\" In all events, PF/PM lesions are benign tumor growths that do not metastasize.\n\nPF/PM lesions may grow at alarming rates, exhibit abnormal histopathologies (e.g. high numbers and overcrowding of cells), and have other elements that are suggestive of a malignancy. Consequently, they have been mistakenly diagnosed as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (also termed malignant fibrous histiocytoma), rhabdomyosarcoma, or other types of sarcoma and treated unnecessarily with aggressive measures used for such malignancies, e.g. wide surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The majority of PF/PM lesions are successfully treated with strictly conservative and supportive measures.\n\nPresentation\nPF/PM lesions occur primarily in middle-aged and older adults (peak age of onset 50 to 55 years/old) with no appreciable differences in their incidences between males and females. Only very rare cases have been reported in children and adolescents. In up to 20% to 30% of cases, these lesions are apparently preceded by some sort of mechanical injury. Individuals commonly present within 1–3 weeks or, rarely, longer times (e.g. 3 months) of noticing a rapidly growing, small (<5 cm. in size) mass or swelling in the subcutaneous tissues or muscles of an extremity or, less commonly, the trunk wall, head, or neck areas. Uncommonly, the lesions are ulcerated. In rare cases, the lesions are extensive and highly disruptive, e.g. PF/PM has presented with lockjaw, i.e.",

The international mathematical olympiad (imo) is an annual competition for pre-college students, featuring six highly challenging mathematical problems.

About 100 countries participate in this event, sending teams of up to six students, one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.\n\nThe problems at the imo cover a wide range of mathematical topics, including complex algebra, pre-calculus, projective and complex geometry, functional equations, and number theory. Although calculus is allowed in the solutions, it is not required as the problems are designed to be understood by anyone with a basic grasp of mathematics, but their solutions demand more advanced knowledge and ingenuity.\n\nThe selection process for the imo varies by country, usually involving a series of tests with gradually increasing difficulty. Students must be under 20 years old and cannot be registered at a tertiary institution. They can participate in the imo multiple times, subject to these conditions. Awards are given to a percentage of the individual contestants, while team scores are unofficially compared, putting more emphasis on individual achievements rather than team rankings.\n\nThe imo has a rich history, having been held every year since its inception, except in 1980, when it was canceled due to internal strife in mongolia. Originally founded for eastern european countries in the warsaw pact, the competition has expanded, and now other countries participate as well. Several students have excelled in the imo, winning multiple gold medals, and some former participants have become notable mathematicians and won prestigious awards like the fields medal.\n\nThe imo exam consists of six problems, each worth seven points, with a maximum total score of 42 points. The examination takes place over two days, with students given four-and-a-half hours each day to solve three problems. Problems can be submitted by participating countries, and the imo jury, comprising team leaders, selects the final six problems. \n\n<user> How do countries select their teams for the imo? \n\n<assistant> The selection process for imo teams varies greatly between countries. In some countries, particularly in east asia, a rigorous selection process consists of several tests with a difficulty level comparable to the imo itself. For example, chinese contestants go through a selection camp.\n\nIn other countries, such as the united states, potential team members participate in a series of standalone competitions that progressively increase in difficulty. The selection process includes multiple stages, such as the american mathematics competitions (amc), the american invitational mathematics examination (aime), and the united states of america mathematical olympiad (usamo), all of which are competitions in their own right. High-scoring students in the final competition may also be invited to a summer camp, similar to that in china.\n\nOverall, the selection process in each country aims to identify the best-performing students to represent them at the imo, through either a series of increasingly difficult contests or an intensive training camp. \n\n<user> How has google supported the international mathematical olympiad? \n\n<assistant> In january 2011, google made a significant contribution to the international mathematical olympiad by donating €1 million to the imo organization. This generous donation helped cover the costs of the global events for the next five years (from 2011 to 2015). Google's support demonstrates the company's commitment to promoting mathematical excellence and nurturing young talent in the field of mathematics.\n\nCorporate sponsorship and donations, like google's, are important for international competitions like the imo to maintain their operations and continue inspiring and educating talented students. Besides the financial support, such backing also serves to raise awareness and recognition of the competition and may encourage more students to participate in mathematical activities and strive for success in such prestigious events.\n\nAs a technology company with a deep focus on innovation, research, and development, google is actively involved in various initiatives that promote stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education. Supporting the international mathematical olympiad is a natural extension of this commitment and an effective way to contribute to fostering the next generation of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers who may one day make a significant impact in their respective fields. \n\n<user> Can you provide more details about the problems and format of the examination? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! The international mathematical olympiad (imo) examination consists of six problems, each worth seven points, making the maximum total score 42 points. No calculators or other electronic devices are allowed during the examination.\n\nThe examination takes place over two consecutive days. On each day, contestants have four-and-a-half hours to work on and solve three problems. The problems are drawn from various areas of secondary school mathematics such as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. These problems do not require knowledge of higher mathematics like calculus or analysis. In fact, solutions to the problems are often short and elementary in nature. However, the problems are formulated in a way that disguises their solutions, making them difficult to decipher and requiring a high level of ingenuity to solve.\n\nThe problems often feature algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, although construction problems have become less popular in recent years.\n\nEach participating country, other than the host country, may submit suggested problems to the problem selection committee, provided by the host country. This committee then shortlists the submitted problems. The imo jury, comprised of arriving team leaders, is responsible for all formal decisions related to the contest, including selecting the final six problems from the shortlist. The jury strives to order the problems in increasing difficulty from q1 to q6.\n\nAs team leaders know the problems in advance, they are kept strictly separated and under observation to ensure fairness. The contestants' scores are then determined through an agreement between the leader and deputy leader of each country and coordinators provided by the host country. In case of disputes, the chief coordinator or the imo jury can be involved in resolving the issue. ",

The college also has satellite sites across two other locations: gainsborough and newark-on-trent in nottinghamshire. The latter site was established after a merger with the former newark and sherwood college in 2007. These two branch sites are branded as gainsborough college and newark college, respectively. In total, more than 11,000 students are enrolled across the three sites, making lincoln college one of the largest educational establishments in the county of lincolnshire.

In the early 1990s it offered degrees and HNDs in Business Studies, Electronics, and Computer Studies in conjunction with Nottingham Trent University, becoming an associate college in 1994. In 1997 the Principal, Allan Crease, in a speech to the Association of Colleges criticised the means of funding from the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), where money was allocated by numbers at the college, and staff received less pay than those at school.\n\nIn the late 1990s the University of Lincoln was being developed, subsuming Lincoln College of Art, and offered similar courses to the college, but the university was not fully built until the mid-2000s. In the late 1990s the college had a student population of around 15,000 and over 20,000 by 2001.\n\nIt soon after changed its name to Lincoln College, not least because North Lincolnshire was an area not covered by the college.

It is a sun- and heat-loving plant that does not tolerate frost or freezing temperatures well. In areas with cool seasonal temperatures or frost, the growth and flowering of the plant may be limited or impacted.\n\nIn regions with more constant seasonal temperatures and regular rainfall, moringa oleifera can flower twice or even all year round. However, in seasonally cool regions, flowering generally occurs once a year, late in spring to early summer. For the northern hemisphere, this would be between april and june, and for the southern hemisphere, between october and december.\n\nIf you decide to plant a moringa oleifera tree in your garden, it's essential to ensure that it's protected from freezing temperatures or frost. You may also consider growing it in a large container that can be moved indoors during the colder months to maintain favorable conditions. Remember that moringa oleifera prefers a neutral to slightly acidic, well-drained sandy or loamy soil for optimal growth.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that the tree's flowering and fruiting might be limited or restricted when planted in a region with cool seasonal temperatures. Nonetheless, experimenting with its cultivation and providing a suitable environment could yield a plant capable of flowering and producing pods. \n\n<user> Thank you for the information! i would still like to try planting a moringa tree. what are the best practices to follow for planting and propagating one in my garden? \n\n<assistant> I'm glad you're interested in planting a moringa tree. To increase your chances of success and to care for it properly, follow these best practices:\n\n1. Soil preparation: in tropical cultivation, soil erosion can be a major problem. Plowing is needed only for high planting densities, and for low planting densities, digging pits and refilling them with soil is preferable. Create optimal pits that are 50 cm (approx. 20 inches) deep and 50 cm wide to ensure good root system penetration without causing excessive land erosion.\n\n2. Propagation: moringa oleifera can be propagated from seed or cuttings. Direct seeding is possible since it has a high germination rate. You can germinate moringa seeds in well-draining soil at any time of the year. Alternatively, you can use cuttings for vegetative propagation. Choose cuttings that are approximately 1 meter (3.3 feet) in length and have a diameter of at least 4 cm (1.6 inches).\n\n3. Planting: choose a location with full sunlight exposure and well-drained, sandy or loamy soil with a neutral to slightly acidic ph (6.3 to 7.0). Keep in mind that moringa oleifera does not tolerate waterlogged soil, as the roots can rot. After preparing the soil and planting the seeds or cuttings, maintain consistent watering without overwatering.\n\n4. Pruning and care: moringa oleifera can be cut back annually to 1–2 meters (3–6 feet) and allowed to regrow, keeping the pods and leaves within arm's reach. Regular pruning methods, such as pollarding, coppicing, and lopping, will promote branching, increase production, and facilitate harvesting.\n\n5. Protection from cold temperatures: since moringa oleifera is not frost-tolerant, providing a frost-free environment is crucial for its survival. In locations with cool seasonal temperatures, consider planting it in a large container that can be moved indoors during colder months.\n\nBy following these guidelines and providing a well-suited environment, you can increase the chances of successfully cultivating a moringa tree in your garden. Keep in mind that optimal growth and fruiting will depend on your location's specific conditions. \n\n<user> I've read that moringa oleifera has numerous uses, including water purification. how does it work for purifying water? \n\n<assistant> Moringa oleifera seeds have been found useful for water purification due to their natural coagulant properties. The seeds contain a positively charged protein called the moringa oleifera cationic protein (mocp). When crushed seeds are added to impure water, this protein binds to negatively charged particles, such as dirt, bacteria, and other impurities that are then coagulated into larger particles.\n\nAs these larger particles settle to the bottom of the container, the process is known as sedimentation, which substantially reduces water turbidity. It's important to note, however, that this method is more effective in reducing suspended solids and some bacteria, but it may not eliminate all pathogens, viruses, or chemical contaminants. Consequently, while moringa seed-based water purification can significantly improve water quality, it should be used in conjunction with other water purification methods or filtration systems to ensure the safest possible drinking water.\n\nTo purify water using moringa oleifera seeds, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Remove the seeds from the pods and crush them into a fine powder.\n2. Mix the powder with a small amount of clean water to form a paste.\n3. Add the paste to the impure water and stir thoroughly, allowing the coagulation process to occur.\n4. Allow the water to settle for some time, during which the impurities will sink to the bottom.\n5. Carefully pour the clear water from the top into a separate container, leaving the sediment behind.\n\nRemember that moringa-based water purification is a natural method and does not guarantee the removal of all contaminants, so additional purification or filtering methods are recommended for optimal safety. \n\n<user> What's the top country producing moringa? \n\n<assistant> India is the largest producer of moringa oleifera. The country has an annual production of 1.2 million tonnes of fruits, cultivated in an area of approximately 380 km². Moringa is highly valued in india, not only for its nutritional and medicinal properties but also for its widespread use in traditional herbal medicine.\n\nIn addition to india, moringa oleifera is cultivated and grows in other regions such as central america, the caribbean, northern countries of south america, africa, south and southeast asia, and various countries of oceania. However, india still remains the top producer, embracing the benefits and uses of this versatile plant. ",
        "current_turn": "<user> I want to plant a moringa oleifera tree in my garden, but i live in a region with cool seasonal temperatures. can you help me understand whether it will flower, and if so, how often? \n\n<assistant> Moringa oleifera is primarily suited for semiarid, tropical, and subtropical regions, corresponding to usda hardiness zones 9 and 10. It is a sun- and heat-loving plant that does not tolerate frost or freezing temperatures well. In areas with cool seasonal temperatures or frost, the growth and flowering of the plant may be limited or impacted.\n\nIn regions with more constant seasonal temperatures and regular rainfall, moringa oleifera can flower twice or even all year round. However, in seasonally cool regions, flowering generally occurs once a year, late in spring to early summer. For the northern hemisphere, this would be between april and june, and for the southern hemisphere, between october and december.\n\nIf you decide to plant a moringa oleifera tree in your garden, it's essential to ensure that it's protected from freezing temperatures or frost. You may also consider growing it in a large container that can be moved indoors during the colder months to maintain favorable conditions. Remember that moringa oleifera prefers a neutral to slightly acidic, well-drained sandy or loamy soil for optimal growth.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that the tree's flowering and fruiting might be limited or restricted when planted in a region with cool seasonal temperatures.

        "reference": "Moringa oleifera is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree of the family Moringaceae, native to the Indian subcontinent. Common names include moringa, drumstick tree (from the long, slender, triangular seed-pods), horseradish tree (from the taste of the roots, which resembles horseradish), and ben oil tree or benzolive tree.\n\nIt is widely cultivated for its young seed pods and leaves, used as vegetables and for traditional herbal medicine. It is also used for water purification. Although listed as an invasive species in several countries, M. oleifera has \"not been observed invading intact habitats or displacing native flora\", so \"should be regarded at present as a widely cultivated species with low invasive potential.\"\n\nEtymology and common names\nThe genus name Moringa derives from the Tamil word, murungai, meaning \"twisted pod\", alludes to the young fruit.  The species name oleifera is derived from the Latin words oleum \"oil\" and ferre \"to bear\".\n\nThe plant has numerous common names across regions where it is cultivated, with drumstick tree, horse radish tree or simply moringa used in English.\n\nDescription\n\nM. oleifera is a fast-growing, deciduous tree that can reach a height of 10–12 m (32–40 ft) and trunk diameter of 45 cm (1.5 ft). The bark has a whitish-grey color and is surrounded by thick cork. Young shoots have purplish or greenish-white, hairy bark. The tree has an open crown of drooping, fragile branches, and the leaves build up a feathery foliage of tripinnate leaves.\n\nThe flowers are fragrant and hermaphroditic, surrounded by five unequal, thinly veined, yellowish-white petals. The flowers are about 1.0–1.5 cm (1/2 in) long and 2.0 cm (3/4  in) broad. They grow on slender, hairy stalks in spreading or drooping flower clusters, which have a length of 10–25 cm.\n\nFlowering begins within the first six months after planting. In seasonally cool regions, flowering only occurs once a year in late Spring and early Summer (northern hemisphere between April and June, southern hemisphere between October and December). In more constant seasonal temperatures and with constant rainfall, flowering can happen twice or even all year-round.\n\nThe fruit is a hanging, three-sided brown capsule of 20–45 cm size, which holds dark brown, globular seeds with a diameter around 1 cm. The seeds have three whitish papery wings and are dispersed by wind and water.\n\nIn cultivation, it is often cut back annually to 1–2 m (3–6 ft) and allowed to regrow so the pods and leaves remain within arm's reach.\n\nTaxonomy\nFrench botanist François Alexandre Pierre de Garsault described the species as Balanus myrepsica, but his names are not accepted as valid, as he did not always give his descriptions binomial names.\n\nFrench naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck described the species in 1785. A combined analysis of morphology and DNA shows that M. oleifera is most closely related to M. concanensis, and the common ancestor of these two diverged from the lineage of M. peregrina.\n\nCultivation\nThe moringa tree is grown mainly in semiarid, tropical, and subtropical areas, corresponding in the United States to USDA hardiness zones 9 and 10. It tolerates a wide range of soil conditions, but prefers a neutral to slightly acidic (pH 6.3 to 7.0), well-drained, sandy or loamy soil. In waterlogged soil, the roots have a tendency to rot.  Moringa is a sun- and heat-loving plant, and does not tolerate freezing or frost. Moringa is particularly suitable for dry regions, as it can be grown using rainwater without expensive irrigation techniques.\n\nProduction area\nIndia is the largest producer of moringa, with an annual production of 1.2 million tonnes of fruits from an area of 380 km2.\n\nMoringa is grown in home gardens and as living fences in South Asia and Southeast Asia, where it is commonly sold in local markets. In the Philippines and Indonesia, it is commonly grown for its leaves, which are used as food. Moringa is also actively cultivated by the World Vegetable Center in Taiwan, a center for vegetable research.\n\nMore generally, moringa grows in the wild or is cultivated in Central America and the Caribbean, northern countries of South America, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and various countries of Oceania.\n\nAs of 2010, cultivation in Hawaii, for commercial distribution in the United States, was in its early stages.\n\nCultivation practice\n\nSoil preparations\nIn tropical cultivation, soil erosion is a major problem, requiring soil treatment to be as shallow as possible. Plowing is required only for high planting densities. In low planting densities, digging pits and refilling them with soil is preferable to ensure good root system penetration without causing too much land erosion. Optimal pits are  deep and  wide.\n\nPropagation\nMoringa can be propagated from seed or cuttings. \nDirect seeding is possible because the germination rate of M. oleifera is high. Moringa seeds can be germinated year-round in well-draining soil. Cuttings of 1 m length and at least 4 cm diameter can be used for vegetative propagation.\n\nBreeding\nIn India, from where moringa most likely originated, the diversity of wild types gives a good basis for breeding programs. In countries where moringa has been introduced, the diversity is usually much smaller among the cultivar types. Locally well-adapted wild types, though, can be found in most regions.\n\nBecause moringa is cultivated and used in different ways,  breeding aims for an annual or a perennial plant are obviously different. The yield stability of fruits is an important breeding aim for the commercial cultivation in India, where moringa is cultivated as an annual. On less favorable locations, perennial cultivation has big advantages, such as less erosion. In Pakistan, varieties have been tested for the nutritional composition of their leaves on different locations. India selects for a higher number of pods and dwarf or semidwarf varieties. Breeders in Tanzania, though, are selecting for higher oil content.\n\nYield and harvest\nM. oleifera can be cultivated for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for oil extraction and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation. Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached. Pollarding, coppicing, and lopping or pruning are recommended to promote branching, increase production, and facilitate harvesting.\n\nFruits \nWhen the plant is grown from cuttings, the first harvest can take place 6–8 months after planting. Often, the fruits are not produced in the first year, and the yield is generally low during the first few years. By year two, it produces around 300 pods, by year three around 400–500. A good tree can yield 1000 or more pods. In India, a hectare can produce 31 tons of pods per year. Under North Indian conditions, the fruits ripen during the summer. Sometimes, particularly in South India, flowers and fruit appear twice a year, so two harvests occur, in July to September and March to April.",

Ian hacking is known for his historical approach to the philosophy of science. He was influenced by other philosophers like kuhn, lakatos, and feyerabend. Hacking focused on the experimental and engineering practices of science, which helped shift the focus from just theoretical aspects to a more practical understanding of science.\n\nNow, \"entity realism\" is a viewpoint that hacking proposed in the study of science. It suggests that we should have a realistic perspective towards the answers discovered by well-established sciences while being skeptical about scientific theories. In other words, we should believe that the things discovered by reliable sciences are real, but remain cautious about the overall theories that try to explain them. This approach helps us develop a more balanced and practical understanding of the scientific world. \n\n<user> Interesting! how did hacking's work change after 1990? and could you explain more about his idea of \"transcendental nominalism\"? \n\n<assistant> After 1990, ian hacking shifted his focus from the natural sciences to the human sciences, partly due to the influence of french philosopher michel foucault.

        "reference": "Ian MacDougall Hacking   (born February 18, 1936) is a Canadian philosopher specializing in the philosophy of science. Throughout his career, he has won numerous awards, such as the Killam Prize for the Humanities and the Balzan Prize, and been a member of many prestigious groups, including the Order of Canada, the Royal Society of Canada and the British Academy.\n\nLife \n\nBorn in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he earned undergraduate degrees from the University of British Columbia (1956) and the University of Cambridge (1958), where he was a student at Trinity College. Hacking also earned his PhD at Cambridge (1962), under the direction of Casimir Lewy, a former student of Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nHe started his teaching career as an instructor at Princeton University in 1960 but, after just one year, moved to the University of Virginia as an assistant professor. After working as a research fellow at Cambridge from 1962 to 1964, he taught at his alma mater, UBC, first as an assistant professor and later as an associate professor from 1964 to 1969. He became a lecturer at Cambridge in 1969 before shifting to Stanford University in 1974. After teaching for several years at Stanford, he spent a year at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Bielefeld, Germany, from 1982 to 1983. Hacking was promoted to Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto in 1983 and University Professor, the highest honour the University of Toronto bestows on faculty, in 1991. From 2000 to 2006, he held the Chair of Philosophy and History of Scientific Concepts at the Collège de France. Hacking is the first Anglophone to be elected to a permanent chair in the Collège's history. After retiring from the Collège de France, Hacking was a professor of philosophy at UC Santa Cruz, from 2008 to 2010. He concluded his teaching career in 2011 as a visiting professor at the University of Cape Town.\n\nPhilosophical work\n\nInfluenced by debates involving Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend and others, Hacking is known for bringing a historical approach to the philosophy of science. The fourth edition (2010) of Feyerabend's 1975 book Against Method, and the 50th anniversary edition (2012) of Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions include an Introduction by Hacking. He is sometimes described as a member of the \"Stanford School\" in philosophy of science, a group that also includes John Dupré, Nancy Cartwright and Peter Galison. Hacking himself still identifies as a Cambridge analytic philosopher. Hacking has been a main proponent of a realism about science called \"entity realism.\" This form of realism encourages a realistic stance towards answers to the scientific unknowns hypothesized by mature sciences, but skepticism towards scientific theories. Hacking has also been influential in directing attention to the experimental and even engineering practices of science, and their relative autonomy from theory. Because of this, Hacking moved philosophical thinking a step further than the initial historical, but heavily theory-focused, turn of Kuhn and others.\n\nAfter 1990, Hacking shifted his focus somewhat from the natural sciences to the human sciences, partly under the influence of the work of Michel Foucault. Foucault was an influence as early as 1975 when Hacking wrote Why Does Language Matter to Philosophy? and The Emergence of Probability. In the latter book, Hacking proposed that the modern schism between subjective or personalistic probability, and the long-run frequency interpretation, emerged in the early modern era as an epistemological \"break\" involving two incompatible models of uncertainty and chance. As history, the idea of a sharp break has been criticized, but competing 'frequentist' and 'subjective' interpretations of probability still remain today. Foucault's approach to knowledge systems and power is also reflected in Hacking's work on the historical mutability of psychiatric disorders and institutional roles for statistical reasoning in the 19th century. He labels his approach to the human sciences transcendental nominalism<ref>See Transcendence (philosophy) and Nominalism.</ref> (also dynamic nominalism or dialectical realism), a historicised form of nominalism that traces the mutual interactions over time between the phenomena of the human world and our conceptions and classifications of them.",

They lost their opening game of the 2016 NWSL Championship tournament (playoffs).\n\nBackground\n\nSeason review\n\nApril\nThe Thorns began their season at Providence Park as they faced off against expansion team Orlando Pride in the latter's inaugural match.  Former Thorn Steph Catley was able to strike first for Orlando in the 12th minute.  Portland would soon respond with goals from Dagný Brynjarsdóttir in the 25th minute and Linsey Horan in the 81st minute.  Both goals would be assisted by captain Tobin Heath.  Thorns FC would win their home opener 2-1.\n\nFor their last match in April, the Thorns traveled to Kansas City where they would receive a 1-1 draw.  Shea Groom was able to strike first with a goal in the 30th minute; however, Lindsey Horan was able to level for the Thorns in the 78th minute, again assisted by Tobin Heath.\n\nPosition at the end of April\n\nMay\nThe Thorns began their month of May continuing their 4-game road spell against the Boston Breakers where Dagný Brynjarsdóttir scored the lone goal and Tobin Heath continued her assist streak to 4 in a row.

The team would end up drawing 0-0 with Tobin Heath acquiring two yellow cards, thus suspending her for the next match against local rivals Seattle Reign FC.\n\nThe Thorns finished their 4 away matches in Seattle as they faced off against Reign FC.  Nadia Nadim would score her first of the season with an assist by Meg Morris; however, Seattle would respond within 3 minutes by a goal from Beverly Yanez, equalizing at 1-1.  Both teams would settle for the draw.\n\nIn the first of a two-game home stand, the Thorns secured a 3-1 win over the then-first-place Washington Spirit.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I admire Paul Robinson for his climbing achievements. Can you tell me more about his most notable climbing feats and competition results? \n\n<assistant> Absolutely! Paul robinson is an accomplished professional rock climber, specializing in bouldering. He has established and repeated several v15 bouldering problems in places like hueco tanks, the buttermilks, and magic wood.\n\nIn competition, robinson has an impressive track record. In 2007, he took second place at the 8th annual american bouldering series (abs) national championships, and won the event in 2008. He also placed third at the 2008 ifsc bouldering world cup in vail, colorado. Over the years, he continued to excel, with placings such as second at the 2009 abs national championships, fourth at the 2009 ifsc bouldering world cup in vail, third in the 2013 dark horse series iv, and sixth in the 2013 ifsc bouldering world cup in vail.\n\nAmong robinson's notable climbs are the third ascent of jade (v14) in rocky mountain national park in 2007, the flash of the v13 nagual boulder, the second ascent of terremer (v15) in hueco tanks in 2008, and the first ascent of lucid dreaming (proposed v16, later v15) in the buttermilks in 2010. He spent the summer of 2010 in rocklands, south africa, where he achieved the second ascent of monkey wedding, a v15 problem, and numerous other achievements. In 2011, he took the third ascent of trip hop (v15) and claimed two v15 second ascents in europe. In 2012, he established meadowlark lemon (v14) and claimed the second ascent of paint it black (v15). \n\n<user> What's the significance of flashing a v13 boulder problem? \n\n<assistant> Flashing a boulder problem means completing it on the first attempt without having tried the problem or seen someone else climb it before. The term \"flash\" signifies that the climber has been able to understand the problem's sequence and execute it flawlessly on the first try. Flashing a v13 boulder problem is especially significant because v13 is considered to be an extremely difficult grade, reserved for elite climbers. \n\nWhen paul robinson flashed the v13 nagual boulder, it demonstrated his remarkable skill, strength, and problem-solving capabilities. Achieving a flash at such a high difficulty level is a rare accomplishment. At the time, robinson was only the second person ever to have flashed a v13 boulder problem, after james pearson. This accomplishment further solidifies his status as one of the top boulderers in the world. \n\n<user> How does the lucid dreaming problem in the buttermilks compare to other problems of a similar grade that he's climbed? \n\n<assistant> Lucid dreaming is a highball bouldering problem in the buttermilks, located near bishop, california. When paul robinson first climbed it in 2010, he proposed a grade of v16, which would have been the highest grade assigned to any bouldering problem at that time. However, he later suggested that lucid dreaming might be a v15 instead.\n\nThe boulder itself is about 50 feet from ground to top, with a steep overhang at the beginning and a slab traversal towards the end. The primary challenge of lucid dreaming lies in the two consecutive v12 moves near the start, both featuring small, technical holds. This makes it different from other v15 problems that robinson has climbed, as the crux of the difficulty is concentrated in a few powerful moves.\n\nIn comparison, other v15 problems he has climbed, like terremer in hueco tanks or monkey wedding in rocklands, may have diverse and sustained challenges throughout the problem. The uniqueness of each climb ultimately depends on factors such as holds, climbing style, and route sequence. While lucid dreaming stands out for its concentrated challenges, each v15 problem has its distinct characteristics that test the climber's capabilities in different ways. \n\n<user> How does paul robinson's accomplishments measure up against other famous climbers like chris sharma and daniel woods? \n\n<assistant> Paul robinson, chris sharma, and daniel woods are all highly accomplished climbers with impressive records. While their achievements are distinct, comparisons can be made to better understand their individual accomplishments.\n\nPaul robinson is renowned for his prowess in bouldering, having established and repeated several v15 bouldering problems. His flashes, onsights, and competition performances showcase his remarkable skill in the sport. In particular, his one-attempt flash of the v13 nagual boulder stands out as a major accomplishment.\n\nChris sharma is often considered one of the best rock climbers in the world. His achievements span both sport climbing and bouldering, with numerous first ascents of routes rated 5.15 and high-grade bouldering problems. His iconic climbs include \"jumbo love,\" the first-ever 5.15b route, and \"es pontas,\" a deep-water solo climb in mallorca. While sharma has a broader focus across different climbing disciplines, his impact and legacy in the sport are undeniable.\n\nDaniel woods is another accomplished boulderer with multiple v15 and v16 problems under his belt. His accomplishments include establishing \"the process,\" a v16 in bishop, california, and the first ascent of \"hypnotized minds\" (v16) in rocky mountain national park. In competition, he has claimed multiple abs national championships and consistently ranked highly in the ifsc world cup events.\n\nAll three of these climbers have made significant contributions to the sport of climbing, continually pushing the limits and inspiring others. Their accomplishments, while impressive in their own right, are part of a broader, growing community of climbers seeking to redefine what is possible in the sport. ",

        "reference": "Paul David Robinson (born August 28, 1987) is an American professional rock climber who specializes in bouldering. He has established and repeated several bouldering problems at the V15 difficulty rating, in such areas as Hueco Tanks, the Buttermilks, and Magic Wood. In 2007, Robinson became the second climber in history to successfully climb a V13 boulder problem in one attempt.\n\nCompetitions \nIn 2007, Paul Robinson took second place at the 8th Annual American Bouldering Series (ABS) National Championships. The following year, Robinson took first place at the competition, beating Chris Sharma and Sean McColl. Later that year, he took third place at the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) Bouldering World Cup in Vail, Colorado. In 2009, Robinson competed once again in the ABS National Championships, this time taking second place behind Daniel Woods. At the IFSC Bouldering World Cup in Vail, he completed three of the four finals problems, placing him in fourth behind Kilian Fischhuber. In January 2013, Robinson took third place in the finals of the Dark Horse Series IV bouldering competition. The following June, Robinson reached the finals of the IFSC Bouldering World Cup in Vail, but was unable to finish any of the final boulders and took sixth place.\n\nNotable ascents \n\nIn August 2007, Robinson made the third ascent of Jade, a V14 bouldering problem in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Later that year, he climbed the V13 Nagual boulder in one attempt, an accomplishment known as a \"flash\". This made Robinson the second person to have flashed a V13, after James Pearson. The following January, Robinson claimed the second ascent of Terremer, a V15 boulder in Hueco Tanks, Texas. The problem was established by Swiss climber Fred Nicole two years earlier. At the time, it was regarded as the most challenging problem at Hueco Tanks, and Robinson described it as \"the hardest boulder I have ever done so far.\"\n\nOn 30 March 2010, Robinson claimed the first ascent of Lucid Dreaming, a highball bouldering problem in the Buttermilks near Bishop, California. He originally proposed a grade of V16, the highest bouldering grade that had yet been assigned to a problem, but he later suggested Lucid Dreaming might be a V15. The boulder is  from ground to top, beginning with a steep overhang and ending with a slab traversal. Much of the difficulty of the climb comes from two consecutive V12 moves near the beginning, both featuring small, technical holds. The problem was not repeated until January 2014.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, Robinson spent two months climbing in Rocklands, South Africa. His main project was the second ascent of Monkey Wedding, a V15 boulder problem first established in 2002 by Fred Nicole. Other achievements included a flash of The Amphitheater (V12), and two V14 first ascents: The Big Short and Black Eagle. Later that year, Robinson visited Magic Wood in Switzerland, where he established Il Trill, a boulder problem rated 8c on the Fontainebleau scale.\n\nIn February 2011, Robinson took the third ascent of Trip Hop, a V15 problem established by Sébastien Frigault in 2003. The following month, he claimed two V15 second ascents in Europe: The Story of Two Worlds, established in 2005 by Dave Graham, and Angama, established in 2006 by Dai Koyamada. In January 2012, Robinson established Meadowlark Lemon, a V14 sit-start variation of the V13 Meadowlark problem in Red Rock Canyon, Nevada. Later that year, he claimed the second ascent of Paint it Black, a V15 problem established in Rocky Mountain National Park by Daniel Woods.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n IFSC Profile\n 27 Crags Profile\n Interview with Paul Robinson\n\nSee also\n Notable first free ascents\n\nAmerican rock climbers\nLiving people\n1987 births",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I am intrigued by the history of argos and its significance in ancient greece. role of the city during the mycenaean era and the classical period? also, i'd like to learn about how argos was affected by the various wars and conflicts that took place during this time. \n\n<assistant> Argos, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, played a substantial role during the mycenaean era and in the classical period of ancient greece. The city's strategic location on the fertile plain of argolis made it a significant stronghold during the mycenaean era. Its neighboring acropolises, mycenae and tiryns, also contributed to argos becoming an early settlement, thanks to the commanding positions they held in the midst of the argolic plain.\n\nDuring the 7th century bc, argos experienced a significant expansion and grew in power under the rule of king pheidon. Pheidon focused on regaining control over the cities of the argolid and challenging sparta's dominance in the peloponnese. Argos was a main rival of sparta, and their rivalry led to various wars and conflicts.\n\nThe battle of sepeia in 494 bc was a monumental event in argos' history. In this battle, argos suffered a devastating defeat by regional rival sparta. Following this loss, argos experienced a form of stasis, resulting in a democratic transition in the city. However, the defeat and the subsequent upheaval left argos weaker.\n\nDuring the greco-persian wars, argos remained neutral, which led to diplomatic isolation. Despite this, its prestige grew because of this neutrality, allowing argos to organize an alliance against sparta and athens in 421 bc. Unfortunately, the alliance disintegrated after the defeat at the battle of mantinea in 418 bc, further weakening argos.\n\nIn the corinthian wars, argos played a minor role against sparta. For a brief period, the city considered uniting with corinth to create an expanded argolid state, but the plan quickly fell apart. Despite remaining a minor power in greek affairs, argos escaped occupation during the reigns of philip ii and alexander the great, and it was unscathed during the wars of the diadochi. However, pyrrhus of epirus attacked argos in the battle of argos in 272 bc, during which pyrrhus was killed.\n\nOverall, argos experienced significant growth and expansion in the mycenaean era and the classical period, being involved in several wars, conflicts, and alliances. While experiencing some triumphs, it ultimately faced setbacks that weakened its power and influence in the region. \n\n<user> Fascinating! can you dive deeper into the democratic system in classical argos? how did this function during the time, and what events led to democracy being established? \n\n<assistant> Democracy in classical argos was mostly present for the period, except for a brief hiatus between 418 and 416 bc. After the crushing defeat at the battle of sepeia in 494 bc, the city experienced political instability, which resulted in the transition to democracy. The introduction of democratic rule offered a more stable and inclusive form of governance for the people of argos.\n\nThe democratic system was characterized by citizen participation in decision-making, with the general population having a say in the affairs of the city. Although we do not have specific details about the structure of the democratic system in argos, it can be assumed that it resembled other greek city-states' democratic systems. For example, in athens, the main democratic institution was the assembly (ekklesia), where free male citizens assembled to discuss and make decisions regarding city matters.\n\nDespite the establishment of democracy, argos continued to face political challenges and upheavals. However, the democratic system maintained its presence and functioned to involve citizens in the city's governance, fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility. \n\n<user> When discussing the ancient greek city of argos, i've come across the term \"argive.\" can you clarify the meaning of this term and its significance in the context of ancient greek history, particularly the trojan war? \n\n<assistant> The term \"argive\" refers to a resident of the city of argos. However, the term has a broader application in ancient greek history, particularly in the context of the trojan war. In the works of homeric bards, \"argive\" is used to denote the ancient greeks who participated in the assault on the city of troy during the trojan war.\n\nThe connection between argos and the trojan war mainly comes from the prominent role played by the city and its warriors in the conflict. Key figures in the war, such as agamemnon and diomedes, had strong ties to argos and the surrounding region, as they were leaders of the achaean forces.\n\nThus, the term \"argive\" expanded beyond its strict geographical association with argos to encompass a wider range of ancient greek warriors who were involved in the trojan war. This broadened usage signifies the importance of argos and the argolid in the cultural memory of the epic conflict. \n\n<user> How has argos managed to remain a continuously inhabited city for such an extended time? what factors have contributed to its sustained existence throughout history? \n\n<assistant> Argos' continuous habitation for over 7,000 years can be attributed to several factors that have contributed to its sustained existence throughout history. Here are some of the main factors that played a crucial role in the city's endurance:\n\n1. Strategic location: argos is situated in the fertile plain of argolis, which provides rich agricultural land and consistent water sources. This favorable environment has enabled the city to support a stable population over time.\n\n2. Geographical advantages: argos benefits from a propitious location among other notable cities, such as nemea, corinth, and arcadia. Furthermore, its proximity to lake lerna offered an additional resource at the time. These geographical features enhanced its desirability as a settlement.\n\n3. Military significance: argos has always been a stronghold in the region. Its defensible location and military prowess made it an important center for power during various periods, such as the mycenaean era and beyond. This status helped ensure the city's continued prominence and habitation.\n\n4. Economic stability: throughout history, argos has maintained a stable economy, owed mainly to agriculture, which was, and still is, the backbone of the local economy. With a fertile plain supporting agricultural activities, the economy provided the necessary resources for the population's sustenance and growth.\n\n5. Political influence: despite facing setbacks, argos managed to maintain political relevance throughout much of its history. Its involvement in various alliances, wars, and political events helped ensure its continuous habitation.\n\n6. Cultural significance: argos is deeply rooted in greek mythology and history, which can be seen in the numerous ancient monuments present within the city. Its association with legendary figures like argus and, more broadly, with the trojan war has ensured the city's cultural importance.\n\n7. Adaptation and change: argos has demonstrated an ability to adapt and change amid shifting circumstances throughout its history. For example, following its decline in political power, the city shifted its focus from the ancient agora to other parts of the city for commercial activities.\n\n8. Preservation of historical sites: the presence of many ancient monuments in argos shows a commitment to preserving its historical legacy, which has likely helped to maintain interest in the city through the ages.\n\nBy combining strategic location, geographical advantages, military significance, economic stability, political influence, cultural importance, adaptability, and historical preservation, argos has managed to maintain a continuous and thriving existence over thousands of years. These factors made the city highly attractive for settlement and persistence, ensuring the ongoing habitation of the area throughout numerous changes in history. This unique combination truly highlights the resilience and enduring nature of argos, which continues to thrive even today. ",

        "reference": "Argos (; Greek: Άργος ; Ancient Greek: Ἄργος ) is a city in Argolis, the Peloponnese, Greece and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, and the oldest in Europe. It is the largest city in Argolis and a major center for the area.\n \nSince the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the municipality of Argos-Mykines, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 138.138 km2. It is  from Nafplion, which was its historic harbour. A settlement of great antiquity, Argos has been continuously inhabited as at least a substantial village for the past 7,000 years.\n\nA resident of the city of Argos is known as an Argive ( ,  ; ). However, this term is also used to refer to those ancient Greeks generally who assaulted the city of Troy during the Trojan War; the term is more widely applied by the Homeric bards.\n\nNumerous ancient monuments can be found in the city today. Agriculture is the mainstay of the local economy.\n\nGeography\n\nClimate\nArgos has a hot Mediterranean climate. It is one of the hottest places in Greece during summer.\n\nEtymology \nThere are several proposed etyma. The name is associated with the legendary Argus, the third king of the city in ancient times, who renamed it after himself, thus replacing its older name Phoronikon Asty (Φορωνικόν Άστυ, \"Citadel of Phoroneus\"). Both the personal name and placename are linked to the word αργός (argós), which meant \"white\" or \"shining\";possibly, this had to do with the visual impression given of the Argolic plain during harvest time. According to Strabo, the name could have even originated from the word αγρός \"field\" by antimetathesis of the consonants.\n\nHistory\n\nAntiquity\n\nHerodotus first recorded the myth of the traditional story of Argos being the origin of the ancient Macedonian royal house of the Argead dynasty (Greek: Ἀργεάδαι, Argeádai) of Philip II and Alexander the Great. As a strategic location on the fertile plain of Argolis, Argos was a major stronghold during the Mycenaean era. In classical times, Argos was a powerful rival of Sparta for dominance over the Peloponnese, but was eventually shunned by other Greek city-states after remaining neutral during the Greco-Persian Wars. \n\nThere is evidence of continuous settlement in the area starting with a village about 7000 years ago in the late Neolithic, located on the foot of Aspida hill. Since that time, Argos has been continually inhabited at the same geographical location. And while the name Argos is generally accepted to have a Hellenic Indo-European etymology, Larissa is generally held to derive from a Pre-Greek substrate.\n\nThe city is located at a rather propitious area, among Nemea, Corinth and Arcadia. It also benefitted from its proximity to lake Lerna, which, at the time, was at a distance of one kilometre from the south end of Argos.\n\nArgos was a major stronghold of Mycenaean times, and along with the neighbouring acropolis of Mycenae and Tiryns became a very early settlement because of its commanding positions in the midst of the fertile plain of Argolis.\n\nArchaic Argos\n\nArgos experienced its greatest period of expansion and power under the energetic 7th century BC ruler King Pheidon. Under Pheidon, Argos regained sway over the cities of the Argolid and challenged Sparta’s dominance of the Peloponnese. Spartan dominance is thought to have been interrupted following the Battle of Hyssiae in 669–668 BC, in which Argive troops defeated the Spartans in a hoplite battle. During the time of its greatest power, the city boasted a pottery and bronze sculpturing school, pottery workshops, tanneries and clothes producers. Moreover, at least 25 celebrations took place in the city, in addition to a regular local products exhibition. A sanctuary dedicated to Hera was also found at the same spot where the monastery of Panagia Katekrymeni is located today. Pheidon also extended Argive influence throughout Greece, taking control of the Olympic Games away from the citizens of Elis and appointing himself organizer during his reign. Pheidon is also thought to have introduced reforms for standard weight and measures in Argos, a theory further reinforced with the unearthing of six \"spits\" of iron in an Argive Heraion, possibly remainders of a dedication from Pheidon.\n\nClassical Argos\n\nIn 494 BC, Argos suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of its regional rival, Sparta, at the Battle of Sepeia. Following this defeat, Herodotus tells us the city suffered a form of stasis. The political chaos is thought to have resulted in a democratic transition in the city. Argos did not participate in the Hellenic Alliance against the Persian Invasion of 480 BC. This resulted in a period of diplomatic isolation, although there is evidence of an Argive alliance with Tegea prior to 462 BC.\n\nIn 462 BC, Argos joined a tripartite alliance with Athens and Thessaly. This alliance was somewhat dysfunctional, however, and the Argives are only thought to have provided marginal contributions to the alliance at the Battle of Oenoe and Tanagra. For example, only 1,000 Argive hoplites are thought to have fought alongside the Athenians at the Battle of Tanagra. Following the allies' defeat at Tanagra in 457 BC, the alliance began to fall apart, resulting in its dissolution in 451 BC.\n\nArgos remained neutral or the ineffective ally of Athens during the Archidamian War between Sparta and Athens. Argos' neutrality resulted in a rise of its prestige among other Greek cities, and Argos used this political capital to organize and lead an alliance against Sparta and Athens in 421 BC. This alliance included Mantinea, Corinth, Elis, Thebes, Argos, and eventually Athens. This alliance fell apart, however, after the allied loss at the Battle of Mantinea in 418 BC. This defeat, combined with the raiding of the Argolid by the Epidaurians, resulted in political instability and an eventual oligarchic coup in 417 BC. Although democracy was restored within a year, Argos was left permanently weakened by this coup. This weakening led to a loss of power, which in turn led to the shift of commercial focus from the Ancient Agora to the eastern side of the city, delimited by Danaou and Agiou Konstadinou streets.\n\nArgos played a minor role in the Corinthian Wars against Sparta, and for a short period of time considered uniting with Corinth to form an expanded Argolid state. For a brief period of time, the two poleis combined, but Corinth quickly rebelled against Argive domination, and Argos returned to its traditional boundaries. After this, Argos continued to remain a minor power in Greek affairs.\n\nArgos escaped occupation by Macedon during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great and remained unscathed during the Wars of the Diadochi, however in 272 it was attacked by Pyrrhus of Epirus at the Battle of Argos, in which Pyrrhus was killed.\n\nDemocracy in Classical Argos\n\nArgos was a democracy for most of the classical period, with only a brief hiatus between 418 and 416.",

What can you tell me about it and its history? \n\n<assistant> The cortez motor home was a class-a motor coach that was produced in the united states between the years 1963 and 1979. It was a unique and innovative vehicle for its time, combining comfort and functionality in a stylish design that appealed to many customers.\n\nThe first cortez motor home was manufactured by the clark equipment company, a company better known for their forklifts and heavy machinery. The original model, known as the clark cortez, remained in production from 1963 to 1968. Afterward, in 1971, the manufacturing rights were sold to the kent corporation which continued production until 1979. Along with the change in ownership came a change in the name, from clark cortez to kent cortez.\n\nThe cortez motor home offered several features that made it stand out from other motorhomes of the time. It had a front-wheel-drive system, a diesel or gasoline engine, and an air suspension system for a smoother ride. The coach was built with quality materials and attention to detail and offered comfortable sleeping accommodations, a kitchenette, and a restroom facility. \n\nOver time, the cortez motor home has become a classic and collectible item, sought after by enthusiasts and collectors who appreciate its unique design and historical significance in the motorhome industry. \n\n<user> I noticed there is a person named alexandria ocasio-cortez mentioned in the provided information. as an australian, i am not familiar with her. can you provide some background information about her and her achievements? \n\n<assistant> Alexandria ocasio-cortez, often referred to as aoc, is an american politician and educator who was born on october 13, 1989, in new york city.

The apostles' creed, formulated before the arian controversy, does not explicitly describe the son or the holy spirit as \"god\" or \"consubstantial with the father.\" in contrast, the nicene creed affirms jesus christ as \"very god of very god\" and consubstantial with the father. This distinction emerged to counter the arian teachings that challenged the divinity of jesus and the unity of the holy trinity.\n\nThe athanasian creed, developed about a century after the nicene creed, is neither a product of a known church council nor used in eastern christianity. It greatly expands the description of the relationships between the father, son, and holy spirit, emphasizing their equality and unity. The athanasian creed reiterates the consubstantiality of the three persons of the trinity and clarifies their eternal generation and procession.\n\nWhile all three creeds share the common goal of expressing the core beliefs of christianity, they each have unique characteristics and historical contexts. The apostles' creed provides a simpler, more general statement of faith, primarily focusing on the life, death, and resurrection of jesus christ. The nicene creed, developed to address the arian controversy, emphasizes the divinity and consubstantiality of the father, son, and holy spirit. The athanasian creed further elaborates on the relationships within the holy trinity and clarifies their shared divinity and unity.\n\nEach creed serves various purposes within different christian traditions. The apostles' and nicene creeds are commonly recited in western christianity, with the nicene creed often utilized in the catholic church's liturgy and for professions of faith. The athanasian creed is less prevalent in worship but remains an essential theological statement in regard to the holy trinity. ",

The amended form is also referred to as the Nicene Creed, or the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed for disambiguation.\n\nThe Nicene Creed is the defining statement of belief of Nicene or mainstream Christianity and in those Christian denominations that adhere to it. The Nicene Creed is part of the profession of faith required of those undertaking important functions within the Catholic Church.\n\nNicene Christianity regards Jesus as divine and co-eternal with God the Father. Various non-Nicene doctrines, beliefs, and creeds have been formed since the fourth century, all of which are considered heresies by adherents of Nicene Christianity.\n\nIn Western Christianity, the Nicene Creed is in use alongside the less widespread Apostles' Creed. In musical settings, particularly when sung in Latin, this creed is usually referred to by its first word, Credo. On Sundays and solemnities, one of these two creeds is recited in the Roman Rite Mass after the homily. In the Byzantine Rite, the Nicene Creed is sung or recited at the Divine Liturgy, immediately preceding the Anaphora (eucharistic prayer), and is also recited daily at compline.\n\nHistory \n\nThe purpose of a creed is to provide a doctrinal statement of correct belief. The creeds of Christianity have been drawn up at times of conflict about doctrine: acceptance or rejection of a creed served to distinguish believers and heretics. For that reason, a creed was called in Greek a σύμβολον (symbolon), which originally meant half of a broken object which, when fitted to the other half, verified the bearer's identity. The Greek word passed through Latin symbolum into English \"symbol\", which only later took on the meaning of an outward sign of something.\n\nThe Nicene Creed was adopted to resolve the Arian controversy, whose leader, Arius, a clergyman of Alexandria, \"objected to Alexander's (the bishop of the time) apparent carelessness in blurring the distinction of nature between the Father and the Son by his emphasis on eternal generation\". Emperor Constantine called the Council at Nicaea to resolve the dispute in the church which resulted from the widespread adoption of Arius' teachings, which threatened to destabilize the entire empire. Following the formulation of the Nicene Creed, Arius' teachings were henceforth marked as heresy.\n\nThe Nicene Creed of 325 explicitly affirms the Father as the \"one God\" and as the \"Almighty,\" and Jesus Christ as \"the Son of God\", as \"begotten of ... the essence of the Father,\" and therefore as \"consubstantial with the Father,\" meaning, \"of the same substance\" as the Father; \"very God of very God.\" The Creed of 325 does mention the Holy Spirit but not as \"God\" or as \"consubstantial with the Father.\" The 381 revision of the creed at Constantinople, which is often referred to as the Nicene Creed, speaks of the Holy Spirit as worshipped and glorified with the Father and the Son. The Athanasian Creed, formulated about a century later, which was not the product of any known church council and not used in Eastern Christianity, describes in much greater detail the relationship between Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The earlier Apostles' Creed, apparently formulated before the Arian controversy arose in the fourth century, does not describe the Son or the Holy Spirit as \"God\" or as \"consubstantial with the Father.\"\n\nOriginal Nicene Creed of 325 \nThe original Nicene Creed was first adopted at the First Council of Nicaea, which opened on 19 June 325. The text ends with anathemas against Arian propositions, and these are preceded by the words: \"We believe in the Holy Spirit\" which terminates the statements of belief.\n\nF. J. A. Hort and Adolf von Harnack argued that the Nicene creed was the local creed of Caesarea (an important center of Early Christianity) recited in the council by Eusebius of Caesarea. Their case relied largely on a very specific interpretation of Eusebius' own account of the council's proceedings. More recent scholarship has not been convinced by their arguments. The large number of secondary divergences from the text of the creed quoted by Eusebius make it unlikely that it was used as a starting point by those who drafted the conciliar creed.",

This parliament is sometimes considered the first english parliament, with montfort often referred to as the founder of the commons.\n\nThe background of this parliament goes back to 1258 when king henry iii of england faced a revolt among the english barons. Growing anger about the king's officials raising funds, the influence of his poitevin relatives at court, and his unpopular sicilian policy led to unrest even within the church. A coup d'état occurred on april 30th, leading to the king agreeing to govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen instead of personal rule.\n\nDespite efforts for reforms such as the provisions of oxford and the provisions of westminster, stability was not restored, and england's situation worsened.

Montfort was desperate and followed henry's armies, culminating in the battle of lewes. Montfort emerged victorious, forcing henry to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the provisions of oxford.\n\nIt was under these circumstances that simon de montfort's parliament was held in january 1265, an assembly of diverse representatives and a precursor to the house of commons we know today. \n\n<user> How did the provisions of oxford and westminster affect the political situation in england? \n\n<assistant> The provisions of oxford and the provisions of westminster were two sets of legislative measures passed during the political crisis of the mid-13th century in england, aiming to reform governance and limit the abuse of power by the king and the major barons.\n\nThe provisions of oxford, established in 1258, created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons. This council had the power to appoint england's justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer and would be monitored through triennial parliaments. These provisions were intended to limit king henry iii's personal rule and restructure government operations by allowing more influence from the barons.\n\nAs for the provisions of westminster in 1259, they built upon the oxford provisions while introducing more radical measures. These measures tackled various grievances, such as land law reform, appointment of local officials, regulations on inheritance, and jewish money lending, among other issues.\n\nThough both sets of provisions aimed to create a more efficient and fair government, they contributed to further conflicts between various factions in england. Disagreements and the differing interests of barons like montfort, who sought even more radical reforms, resulted in instability and mounting tensions. The unstable political situation ultimately led to the second barons' war and the rise of simon de montfort as a major player in english politics. \n\n<user> What eventually led to the end of the second barons' war? \n\n<assistant> The second barons' war, a conflict between king henry iii and rebel english barons led by simon de montfort, eventually ended after a series of events that weakened and destabilized montfort's position.\n\nSimon de montfort's parliament in 1265 was meant to solidify his power and expand his base of support. Although it temporarily achieved this objective, montfort faced concurrent internal and external challenges that undermined his ability to maintain control.\n\nThe first challenge arose from internal divisions within montfort's coalition. His radical reform agenda alienated some barons who either supported moderate change or opposed any limitations on the king's power. Montfort failed to maintain the cohesiveness of his coalition, breeding dissent and laying the groundwork for his eventual downfall.\n\nExternally, montfort faced continued opposition from major figures, including henry's eldest son, prince edward (later king edward i). Edward managed to escape captivity after the battle of lewes and mobilized supporters against montfort. An important turning point occurred when gilbert de clare, the powerful earl of gloucester, a key supporter of montfort, defected to the royalist side. This defection undermined montfort's military strength and eroded his base of support.\n\nThe decisive event that marked the end of the second barons' war was the battle of evesham on august 4, 1265. Prince edward led the royalist forces against montfort's army in a battle characterized by a fierce and brutal fight. Montfort was significantly outnumbered, and his forces suffered a crushing defeat. Simon de montfort was killed during the battle, and his body was mutilated as a sign of disrespect.\n\nAfter evesham, the remaining rebel barons were gradually subdued by the royalist forces. The official conclusion of the war was the dictum of kenilworth in 1266, which was a royalist settlement offering pardons in exchange for fines. This settlement allowed the country to move past the conflict, and stability was gradually restored under henry iii and later his son, edward i.\n\nIn the aftermath, the montfortian vision of a more inclusive and representative parliament was largely overshadowed by the restoration of royal authority. It wasn't until the 14th century, under edward i's reign, that the idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliament became the norm, leading to the formation of the house of commons. \n\n<user> What was montfort's main occupation before rising to power? \n\n<assistant> Before rising to power, simon de montfort was mainly known as a nobleman and a military leader. He held the title of the earl of leicester, and he was an influential baron who played a crucial role in political events of the time, including the rebellion against king henry iii. ",

By the 14th century this had become the norm , with the gathering becoming known as the House of Commons . This parliament is sometimes referred to as the first English parliament and Montfort himself is often termed the founder of the Commons . \n\n = = Background = = \n\n In 1258 , King Henry III of England faced a revolt among the English barons . Anger had grown about the way the King 's officials were raising funds , the influence of his Poitevin relatives at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy ; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King . Within Henry 's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems . On 30 April , Hugh Bigod marched into Westminster in the middle of the King 's parliament , backed by his co @-@ conspirators , including Simon de Montfort , the Earl of Leicester , and carried out a coup d 'état . Henry , fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned , agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen , half chosen by the King and half by the barons . \n\n The pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a parliament met in June . The term \" parliament \" had first appeared in the 1230s and 1240s to describe large gatherings of the royal court , and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout Henry 's reign . They were used to agree upon the raising of taxes which , in the 13th century , were single , one @-@ off levies , typically on movable property , intended to support the King 's normal revenues for particular projects . During Henry 's reign , the counties had begun to send regular delegations to these parliaments , and came to represent a broader cross @-@ section of the community than simply the major barons . \n\n The new parliament passed a set of measures known as the Provisions of Oxford , which Henry swore to uphold . These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members , elected solely by the barons , which then had the power to appoint England 's justiciar , chancellor and treasurer , and which would be monitored through triennial parliaments . Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform , intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King 's officials and the major barons . More radical measures were passed by the new council the next year , in the form of the Provisions of Westminster . \n\n The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident . Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown ; others promoted only moderate change , while the conservative barons expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King 's powers . Over the next four years , neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England , and power swung back and forth between the different factions . By early 1263 , what remained of Henry 's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war . Montfort convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue his radical agenda and by October , England faced a likely civil war . Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt . Montfort took Henry and Queen Eleanor prisoner , and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry 's name , the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own , trusted men . \n\n Montfort 's coalition began to quickly fragment , Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England . Henry appealed to his brother @-@ in @-@ law Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute ; Montfort was initially hostile to this idea , but , as war became more likely again , he decided to agree to French arbitration as well . Initially Montfort 's legal arguments held sway , but in January 1264 , Louis announced the Mise of Amiens , condemning the rebels , upholding the King 's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford . The Second Barons ' War finally broke out in April , when Henry led an army into Montfort 's territories . Becoming desperate , Montfort marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May . Despite their numerical superiority , Henry 's forces were overwhelmed . Captured , Henry was forced to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the Provisions of Oxford , leaving him , as historian Adrian Jobson describes , \" little more than a figurehead \" . \n\n = = Parliament = = \n\n",

The episode originally aired on august 23, 2007.\n\nThe episode begins with don making breakfast in bed for betty to celebrate mother's day but ends up spilling the breakfast after tripping on stairs. After the fall, don has a vision of himself as a child, meeting his newborn half-brother adam. Don and betty then talk about joan crawford and betty's recently deceased mother.\n\nAt sterling cooper, don and his co-workers meet with executives from the israeli board of tourism to discuss marketing strategies. Don has lunch with rachel menken, a jewish client, to gain input on the project, but she keeps it professional. Later, she confesses on the phone to her sister that she's developing feelings for don.\n\nMeanwhile, roger and joan's long-running affair is revealed as they meet in a hotel room. Roger suggests joan get an apartment, but she refuses, believing that he will eventually leave her for someone younger.\n\nFreddy rumsen works on a campaign for belle jolie lipstick and has the secretaries of sterling cooper try out samples while the men spy on them. Most women enjoy the activity, but peggy just watches. After the event, she tells freddy that she doesn't want to feel like \"one of a hundred colors in a box\" and refers to a trashcan filled with samples as a \"basket of kisses\". Freddy is impressed and asks her to write some copy for the account.\n\nDon visits midge's apartment but is interrupted by midge's beatnik friend, roy. The three go to the gaslight cafe, where roy antagonizes don over his age and suburban life, criticizing advertising and mass consumption. Don counters by ridiculing roy's vanity and flightiness. Amidst the tension, midge's friend takes the stage and performs a song about the jews' mourning their exile from zion in babylon (psalm 137). \n\nThe episode proceeds with roger presenting joan a gift – a bird in a cage. Joan feels conflicted about their relationship. The episode ends with joan and roger leaving the hotel together, but they pretend to be strangers to avoid suspicion and wait for separate cabs. \n\n<user> Wow, sounds interesting. what were some cultural references and easter eggs in this episode? \n\n<assistant> The episode \"babylon\" is rich with cultural references that help to enhance the story and the era in which it's set. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. Don and betty discuss the film adaptation of the book \"the best of everything\", and the novel \"exodus\" is mentioned as research material for the characters at sterling cooper.\n2. Sal comments on a shade of lipstick, referring to it as \"ethel rosenberg pink\", which references ethel rosenberg, a woman executed for espionage in the 1950s.\n3. The characters discuss adolf eichmann's capture, an event that took place around the time of the episode's setting.\n4. Don and rachel have lunch at the tea room at the pierre, a real hotel in new york that's been in operation since 1930.\n5. Roger gifts joan a bird in a cage, possibly referencing the confinement theme present in the movie \"breakfast at tiffany's\".\n6. Peggy's conversation with joan sheds light on the famous phrase \"the medium is the message\", coined by marshall mcluhan in his book \"understanding media: the extensions of man\". However, it's worth noting that the book was published in 1964, four years after the events in the episode.\n7. The song \"babylon\" performed in the gaslight cafe is based on the biblical psalm 137. The arrangement resembles don mclean's version of the song, released in 1971, a few years after the episode's timeline.\n\nThese references and easter eggs help to paint a vivid picture of the time period and make the episode even more fascinating to watch. \n\n<user> My little sister is interested in this episode too. could you explain what happened in this episode, but make it simple for a child to understand? \n\n<assistant> Of course! In this episode of mad men called \"babylon\", there are a few different stories happening at the same time. One story is about a man named don who tries to make breakfast for his wife, betty, but accidentally spills it. They talk and remember old times together.\n\nAt don's work, they're trying to come up with ideas for a project about israel, so he asks for advice from a lady named rachel. Rachel feels happy about don asking for her help, and she realizes she has special feelings for him.\n\nThere's another story about a man named roger and a woman named joan. They like each other secretly, and they meet in a secret place. Roger gives joan a bird in a cage as a gift, but she doesn't know how to feel about it.\n\nMeanwhile, a lady named peggy works at the same place as don. They have an activity where ladies try on different lipsticks. Peggy watches and feels like she has some good ideas to share. Someone named freddy hears her ideas and asks her to help with writing some words for their work.\n\nAt the end of the episode, some people go to a cafe and listen to a friend sing a song about a sad event from long ago. All these stories show how the different characters feel about their lives and the people around them. That's what makes this episode interesting! ",

        "reference": "\"Babylon\" is the sixth episode of the first season of the American television drama series Mad Men. It was written by Andre and Maria Jacquemetton and directed by Andrew Bernstein. The episode originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on August 23, 2007.\n\nPlot\nDon makes breakfast in bed for Betty to celebrate Mother's Day. However, he trips on his way up the stairs and spills her breakfast. After falling, Don has a vision of himself as a child, meeting his newborn half-brother Adam for the first time. Don and Betty snuggle up in bed and talk about Joan Crawford. Betty is shocked at how old Crawford looks, and wishes that when she is that age, she'll \"just disappear\" instead. Don chides her to not be melancholic when her thoughts turn to her recently deceased mother. He says that \"mourning is just extended self-pity.\"\n\nThe next day at Sterling Cooper, Don and his co-workers meet with executives from the Israeli Board of Tourism to discuss marketing strategies. Don, unsure of what strategy to use, meets Rachel Menken for lunch under the guise of asking her for input because she is Jewish. She keeps their meeting professional, but later she confesses on the phone to her sister that she is developing feelings for Don.\n\nMeanwhile, Roger meets Joan in a hotel room to continue what is revealed to be a long-running affair. Roger wishes that he could have Joan all to himself, and suggests that she get her own apartment. Joan refuses, saying that she will be looking for a more permanent situation and suspects that Roger will eventually leave her for someone younger.\n\nFreddy Rumsen, working on a campaign for Belle Jolie lipstick, does some research by having the secretaries of Sterling Cooper try out new varieties of lipstick. While the secretaries sample the merchandise, the men of the company spy on them from behind a two-way mirror. While most of the women enjoy trying out the samples, Peggy sits by herself, watching. After the event is over, she tells Freddy that she does not want to feel \"like one of a hundred colors in a box\" and refers to a trashcan full of discarded samples as a \"basket of kisses\". Impressed with her way with words, Freddy relays Peggy's comments to the rest of the creative team and expresses the idea that she may have some writing talent. He says listening to her brainstorm was \"like watching a dog play the piano\". Freddy asks Peggy to write some copy for the account.\n\nDon drops by Midge's apartment, but they are interrupted by Midge's beatnik friend Roy, who ribs Don for his age and routine suburban life. The three of them go to The Gaslight Cafe to watch Midge's friend perform. Roy continues to antagonize Don, criticizing the emptiness of advertising and mass consumption while Don ridicules Roy for his vanity and flightiness. They are silenced when Midge's friend takes the stage and performs a song about the Jews' mourning their exile from Zion in Babylon (Psalm 137 as arranged by Philip Hayes).\n\nElsewhere, Roger presents Joan with a gift—a bird in a cage. He expresses regret that he has to share her. Joan is taken aback by the gift, and appears to be conflicted about their relationship. As the song continues, Joan and Roger leave the hotel and, posing as strangers to avoid suspicion, wait for separate cabs.\n\nCultural references\nDon reads The Best of Everything and later he and Betty discuss the film adaptation. Don and his co-workers also read and discuss the novel Exodus as research. Sal refers to a shade of lipstick as \"Ethel Rosenberg pink.\" Rachel refers to the then-recent capture of Adolf Eichmann.\n\nDon asks Rachel to lunch, and she suggests the tea room at The Pierre. While The Pierre is a real hotel in New York (and, as of 2019, has been in continuous operation since 1930), it doesn't have any eatery that would be referred to as a \"tea room\", and Don & Rachel's lunch scene was not shot at the Pierre.\n\nThe bird in the cage given to Joan as a gift could be seen as a reference to the birdcage confinement theme of the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. When Peggy asks whether she should thank Don for the copy writing assignment, Joan says \"the medium is the message,\" a famous phrase coined by Marshall McLuhan in his book Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (this book was published in 1964, four years after the alleged year in which the episode takes place).\n\nThe song Babylon was probably known to folk singers of the time when the chapter happens, nevertheless, the version has the same arrangement as Don McLean version on his album American Pie from 1971, which is the earliest known release of it.\n\nReception\nThe episode was received very positively by critics. Alan Sepinwall, writing for New Jersey's The Star-Ledger, praised its focus on the show's female characters, and in particular the progression of Peggy's story. Andrew Johnston, writing for Slant Magazine, considered it the show's \"most entertaining\" episode to date, and wrote that its ending \"beautifully demonstrates the level of insight that makes Mad Men so special.\"\n\nIn December 2013, Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a full \"A\" grade, writing retrospectively:The episode includes the first major story for Joan, a triumph for Peggy, and a minor but hugely important story point for Rachel. It features Midge for a brief time, and it gives us a taste of both Betty’s view of the world (which seems haunted by her fear that her looks will fade) and the glimmerings of what relationship she has with Sally.",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I'm doing a project on the history of numeral systems, and i'd like a broader understanding of positional notation and its significance in history. can you help me with that? \n\n<assistant> Of course! Positional notation, also known as place-value notation, is a numeral system in which the value of a digit is determined by both the digit itself and its position within the number. This approach allows us to represent larger numbers using fewer symbols and simplifies arithmetic computations when compared to older numeral systems.\n\nOne of the first positional systems was the babylonian numeral system, which had a base of 60. We still see its influence in the way we measure time (60 minutes in an hour) and angles (360 degrees in a circle). Nowadays, the hindu-arabic numeral system (base ten) is the most commonly used globally, likely because it is related to counting with our ten fingers.\n\nBefore positional notation became standard, simpler additive systems like roman numerals were used. Early computing devices like counting rods and abacuses were designed to work with positional numeral systems, making arithmetic operations easier and faster.\n\nOver time, several positional numeral systems were developed across various cultures. The chinese, indian, and arabic civilizations utilized systems that eventually influenced the development of the modern decimal system.\n\nIn addition to integer representations, the implementation of radix points (i.e., decimal points in base ten) allowed for fractions and real numbers to be represented with great accuracy. Mathematicians like abu'l-hasan al-uqlidisi, jamshīd al-kāshī and simon stevin later contributed to the development and adoption of positional decimal fractions.\n\nDid you have any specific questions about the history or evolution of positional notation? \n\n<user> What led to the adoption of the base-10 system globally? \n\n<assistant> The hindu-arabic numeral system, which uses base 10, became the most widespread and commonly used numeral system in the world due to several reasons:\n\n1. Human anatomy: humans have ten fingers, making base-10 intuitive for counting and early arithmetic tasks.\n\n2. Mathematical simplicity: the base-10 system facilitates easy calculations and requires a relatively small set of symbols (0-9) to represent numbers.\n\n3. Historical influence: indian mathematicians played a critical role in developing the decimal system, including the positional notation and the concept of zero. Arab scholars later adopted these principles and transmitted them to the wider world. This transfer of knowledge bolstered the system's influence and facilitated its adoption.\n\n4. European adoption: around the 10th century, european scholars started studying arabic texts and latin translations, carrying the principles of the hindu-arabic numeral system into european mathematics.\n\n5. The printing press: the invention of the printing press in the 15th century helped disseminate mathematical knowledge, including the base-10 system, more rapidly and widely.\n\n6. International trade: as international trade increased, the ease of use and computational advantages of the base-10 system helped it gain dominance over other numeral systems. Merchants and traders adopted the hindu-arabic numeral system because it simplified their work considerably.\n\n7. The french revolution: the french government's promotion of decimal systems, such as decimal currency, decimal time, and the metric system, contributed to the worldwide adoption of base-10 numeral systems. While not all pro-decimal reforms were successful, the decimalization of currency and metric system spread to most parts of the world.\n\nThese factors combined led to the global adoption of the base-10 system, displacing previous numeral systems and making it the standard for modern mathematics and commerce. \n\n<user> Can you make it simple for a kid? \n\n<assistant> Sure! A long time ago, people used different ways to write down numbers. They would use different shapes or symbols for every number, like in roman numerals. But it was hard to do math with these symbols.\n\nThen, some smart people discovered positional notation, which means that the same symbol can mean different things depending on where it is. For example, in the number 555, there are three 5's, but they mean 500, 50, and 5 because of their different positions.\n\nThe main reason we use base-10 (with numbers 0-9) is that we have ten fingers, which makes it easy and natural for us to count. This new way of writing numbers made math easier, and it spread all around the world. Now, we use this system to do all sorts of things, like buying things at the store or measuring how far places are.\n\nSo, positional notation is a way to write and understand numbers that's easy for everyone to use and understand! And that's why we use it today. \n\n<user> I'm curious about the impact of positional notation on the development of ancient and medieval mathematical tools. can you provide some insights on how it influenced those tools and their subsequent advancements? \n\n<assistant> Positional notation had a considerable impact on the development of ancient and medieval mathematical tools. Its simplicity and efficiency meant that computations could be performed much more easily compared to older numeral systems. This led to the creation and evolution of various tools that made use of the positional notation, such as:\n\n1. Counting rods: before the advent of the hindu-arabic numeral system, chinese mathematicians used counting rods to perform arithmetic operations. This positional notation system enabled them to conduct complex calculations and record numbers quickly.\n\n2. Abacus: an abacus is a calculating tool used for arithmetic operations, especially addition and subtraction. Various versions of this tool were used across different cultures, including the roman, chinese, and japanese versions, all of which made use of positional notation. The simplicity of base-10 positional notation made the abacus an efficient tool for merchants, traders, and mathematicians.\n\n3. Indian numerals: indian mathematicians developed a base-10 positional system around the 3rd century bc. Over time, this system evolved and absorbed features like the concept of zero, which allowed for more advanced calculations and greatly helped in the development of algebra.\n\n4. Arabic numerals: the adoption of the hindu-arabic numeral system by arab scholars allowed for the expansion and refinement of mathematical knowledge. Arabic numerals were recorded from the 10th century and allowed for advanced algebraic manipulations and more structured mathematical systems.\n\nThese mathematical tools, influenced by positional notation, played a vital role in the development of mathematical knowledge and techniques during ancient and medieval times.

        "reference": "Positional notation (or place-value notation, or positional numeral system) usually denotes the extension to any base of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system (or decimal system). More generally, a positional system is a numeral system in which the contribution of a digit to the value of a number is the value of the digit multiplied by a factor determined by the position of the digit. In early numeral systems, such as Roman numerals, a digit has only one value: I means one, X means ten and C a hundred (however, the value may be negated if placed before another digit).  In modern positional systems, such as the decimal system, the position of the digit means that its value must be multiplied by some value: in 555, the three identical symbols represent five hundreds, five tens, and five units, respectively, due to their different positions in the digit string.\n\nThe Babylonian numeral system, base 60, was the first positional system to be developed, and its influence is present today in the way time and angles are counted in tallies related to 60, such as 60 minutes in an hour and 360 degrees in a circle. Today, the Hindu–Arabic numeral system (base ten) is the most commonly used system globally. However, the binary numeral system (base two) is used in almost all computers and electronic devices because it is easier to implement efficiently in electronic circuits.\n\nSystems with negative base, complex base or negative digits have been described. Most of them do not require a minus sign for designating negative numbers.\n\nThe use of a radix point (decimal point in base ten), extends to include fractions and allows representing any real number with arbitrary accuracy. With positional notation, arithmetical computations are much simpler than with any older numeral system; this led to the rapid spread of the notation when it was introduced in western Europe.\n\nHistory\n\nToday, the base-10 (decimal) system, which is presumably motivated by counting with the ten fingers, is ubiquitous. Other bases have been used in the past, and some continue to be used today. For example, the Babylonian numeral system, credited as the first positional numeral system, was base-60. However, it lacked a real zero. Initially inferred only from context, later, by about 700 BC, zero came to be indicated by a \"space\" or a \"punctuation symbol\" (such as two slanted wedges) between numerals. It was a placeholder rather than a true zero because it was not used alone or at the end of a number. Numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60) looked the same because the larger number lacked a final placeholder. Only context could differentiate them.\n\nThe polymath Archimedes (ca. 287–212 BC) invented a decimal positional system in his Sand Reckoner which was based on 108 and later led the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss to lament what heights science would have already reached in his days if Archimedes had fully realized the potential of his ingenious discovery.\n\nBefore positional notation became standard, simple additive systems (sign-value notation) such as Roman numerals were used, and accountants in ancient Rome and during the Middle Ages used the abacus or stone counters to do arithmetic.\n\nCounting rods and most abacuses have been used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. With counting rods or abacus to perform arithmetic operations, the writing of the starting, intermediate and final values of a calculation could easily be done with a simple additive system in each position or column. This approach required no memorization of tables (as does positional notation) and could produce practical results quickly. \n\nThe oldest extant positional notation system is that of Chinese rod numerals, used from at least the early 8th century.\nIt isn't clear whether this system was introduced from India or whether it was developed locally.\nIndian numerals originate with the Brahmi numerals of about the 3rd century BC, which symbols were, at the time, not used positionally. \nMedieval Indian numerals are positional, as are the derived Arabic numerals, recorded from the 10th century.\n\nAfter the French Revolution (1789–1799), the new French government promoted the extension of the decimal system.\nSome of those pro-decimal efforts—such as decimal time and the decimal calendar—were unsuccessful.\nOther French pro-decimal efforts—currency decimalisation and the metrication of weights and measures—spread widely out of France to almost the whole world.\n\nHistory of positional fractions \n\nJ. Lennart Berggren notes that positional decimal fractions were used for the first time by Arab mathematician Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi as early as the 10th century. The Jewish mathematician Immanuel Bonfils used decimal fractions around 1350, but did not develop any notation to represent them. The Persian mathematician Jamshīd al-Kāshī made the same discovery of decimal fractions in the 15th century. Al Khwarizmi introduced fractions to Islamic countries in the early 9th century; his fraction presentation was similar to the traditional Chinese mathematical fractions from Sunzi Suanjing. This form of fraction with numerator on top and denominator at bottom without a horizontal bar was also used by 10th century Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi and 15th century Jamshīd al-Kāshī's work \"Arithmetic Key\".\n\nThe adoption of the decimal representation of numbers less than one, a fraction, is often credited to Simon Stevin through his textbook De Thiende; but both Stevin and E. J. Dijksterhuis indicate that Regiomontanus contributed to the European adoption of general decimals:\nEuropean mathematicians, when taking over from the Hindus, via the Arabs, the idea of positional value for integers, neglected to extend this idea to fractions.",

Foodora acquired other food delivery services such as hurrier, suppertime, and heimschmecker in june 2015, and all of these now operate under the foodora brand.\n\nIn september 2015, foodora was acquired by delivery hero and merged with its upscale food delivery brand, urban taste, to operate under the foodora name. In 2018, foodora germany was purchased by the dutch group takeaway, and the transaction was completed in april 2019. Today, foodora gmbh officially belongs to lieferando, a part of takeaway. Delivery hero continues to operate under the foodora brand in other markets, such as finland, norway, and sweden.\n\nThe company's ceo is hans skruvfors. Customers can use foodora's website or mobile app to browse nearby restaurants, place orders, and pay. Foodora then prepares the order, which is picked up by one of their couriers (foodsters) and delivered to the customer in about 30 minutes. Foodora provides both b2c and b2b food delivery services.\n\nIn terms of geographical presence, foodora operates in finland, norway, and sweden. It previously also operated in australia, austria, canada, france, germany, italy, and the netherlands. The reasons for ceasing operations in these countries varied from financial challenges, controversies with worker contracts, and restructuring of the overall business strategy.\n\nIn some locations, such as sweden, foodora is growing rapidly, employing hundreds of riders to meet the demand for fast deliveries. They have even introduced an autonomous delivery robot named doora into their fleet in stockholm in march 2021 to handle quick-commerce deliveries. \n\n<user> I've heard about some controversies involving foodora and their treatment of workers. could you explain more about that? \n\n<assistant> Foodora has indeed faced some controversies regarding its treatment of workers, particularly in terms of their contract status and working conditions. The company has been accused of using \"sham contracts\" with its workers, often labeling them as independent contractors, even though their working conditions resemble that of employees.\n\nFor example, in turin in october 2016, foodora workers organized a protest against a proposed change from hourly work to piece work, which would result in a general reduction in the quality of work. Protests also took place in berlin in 2017 over working conditions.\n\nIn australia, workers have spoken out against the continuously falling rate of pay and policies that encourage dangerous behavior on the road. Foodora responded punitively against some of these workers, and at least two pursued legal action against the company. In november 2018, foodora lost an unfair dismissal case in australia, where the court ruled that its drivers were employees rather than contractors. As a result, the company was ordered to pay compensation.\n\nIn canada, the ontario labour relations board ruled in march 2020 that foodora deliverers were dependent (rather than independent) contractors and could, therefore, unionize. With these ongoing controversies, foodora has had to deal with the challenges they pose in different markets. \n\n<user> It's fascinating that foodora introduced an autonomous delivery robot called doora in stockholm. can you provide more details about how it works and what kind of goods it delivers? \n\n<assistant> Doora is an autonomous delivery robot introduced by foodora in stockholm, sweden, in march 2021. The robot is designed to work in the domain of quick-commerce, which involves the delivery of a wide range of goods on-demand from various retailers.\n\nDoora is capable of delivering household goods, groceries, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and more. As an autonomous robot, it navigates using sophisticated sensors and ai algorithms to reach its destination safely and efficiently. The introduction of doora is a step towards reducing delivery times and improving the overall delivery process.\n\nBy using a robot like doora, companies like foodora can potentially save on labor costs, reduce the reliance on human riders, and address some of the controversies surrounding working conditions for their delivery personnel. It also showcases their commitment to incorporating emerging technologies in their services to adapt to the evolving demands of customers.\n\nIn terms of operations, customers place their orders through foodora's platform, and once the order is prepared, doora picks it up and delivers it to the customer's location. The robot's design emphasizes safety and navigational efficiency while ensuring the timely delivery of goods. ",

        "reference": "Foodora is an online food delivery brand owned by Delivery Hero. It was founded in Munich, Germany and currently operates in Sweden, Norway and Finland.\n\nHistory\n\nFoodora was founded under the name Volo GmbH in Munich in February 2014. It relocated to Berlin when Rocket Internet acquired 100% of the company in April 2015. In June 2015, Foodora also acquired food delivery services Hurrier (in Canada), Suppertime (in Australia), and Heimschmecker (in Austria), which now all operate under the Foodora brand. In September 2015, Delivery Hero acquired Foodora from Rocket Internet. Foodora was then merged with Delivery Hero's upscale food delivery brand, Urban Taste, under the name Foodora.\n\nIn December 2018, the Dutch group Takeaway purchased the German delivery operations of Delivery Hero, including Foodora Germany. On April 1, 2019, the transaction was completed, with Foodora GmbH officially belonging to Lieferando, a part Takeaway. \n\nDelivery Hero continues to operate under the Foodora brand in other markets. As of May 2020, Foodora remains available in Finland, Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe CEO of Foodora is Hans Skruvfors.\n\nOperations\nUsing Foodora's website or mobile app, customers can browse restaurants near them, place their order, and pay. The order is then prepared by the restaurant, picked up by one of Foodora's couriers (foodsters), and delivered to the customer “in about 30 minutes\". Foodora provides both B2C and B2B food delivery services. In Germany, Foodora suffers from high costs of about €12–14 per driver hour. In January 2017, it was reported that Foodora made a loss of approximately €5–6 million per month globally, though the company is trying to reduce costs and improve efficiency. In Sweden, foodora is growing rapidly and has employed hundreds of riders. The Swedes' increased need for fast deliveries has accelerated. In March 2021, Foodora introduced the \nfirst autonomous delivery robot into its fleet in Stockholm. The droid, called Doora, will work in quick-Commerce, delivering anything from household goods, groceries, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and more.\n\nGeographical presence\nFoodora operates in three Nordic countries: Finland,  Norway and Sweden.\n\nFormer operations\nPreviously the company also operated in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.\n\nAustralia\nFoodora had expanded over the Australian market in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. In September 2015, Foodora acquired a local delivery company Suppertime, later re-branding it to Foodora in May. On 1 August 2018, Foodora announced that it was closing operations in Australia on 20 August 2018.\n\nCanada\n\nIn July 2015, Foodora entered the Canadian market by acquiring Toronto-based delivery company Hurrier. They expanded to Montreal in October 2015 and later re-branded both cities to Foodora in January 2016. An expansion to Vancouver occurred in 2016. They expanded to Ottawa in early 2019. In the Summer of 2019, Foodora deliverers in Toronto and Mississauga campaigned to unionize with the support of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers. Foodora claimed that deliverers were independent contractors and therefore were not entitled to form a bargaining unit. The votes were sealed pending the resolution of legal disputes between the delivery workers and the corporation. Foodora rolled out a partnership with the LCBO in September 2019 in Toronto. On 4 March 2020, the Ontario Labour Relations Board, in a landmark decision, ruled that Foodora deliverers were dependent, rather than independent, contractors, and therefore could unionize. On 27 April 2020, Foodora announced that it was closing operations in Canada on 11 May 2020.\n\nNetherlands\nFoodora ended its operations in the Netherlands on 15 October 2018. It had been active in the country since May 2015.\n\nControversies\n\nFoodora has been accused of \"sham contracts\" with its workers. In October 2016, Foodora workers in Turin responded to the proposed change from hourly work to piece work with an organised protest against the general reduction in quality of work. In 2017, Foodora workers protested working conditions in Berlin.\n\nFoodora workers in Australia have spoken out about the company. Workers have protested against the continuously falling rate of pay and policies that encourage dangerous behavior on the road. Also of concern is workers' status as independent contractors despite their working conditions resembling that of employees. Foodora has responded punitively against workers who have spoken out, leading at least two workers to pursue legal action against the company. On 16 November 2018, Foodora lost its unfair dismissal case, as the court ruled that its drivers were classed as employees rather than contractors, and was ordered to pay a former delivery driver almost $16,000 in compensation.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n Official tech blog\n\nOnline food ordering\nOnline retailers of Germany\nRetail companies established in 2015\nTransport companies established in 2015\nInternet properties established in 2015\nFood and drink companies based in Berlin\nLogistics companies",

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you explain commercial paper and its purpose in the financial market? \n\n<assistant> Commercial paper is an unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term obligations such as payroll, inventories, and receivables. It is essentially an \"iou\" and carries a fixed maturity of rarely more than 270 days.\n\nBeing not backed by collateral, only firms with excellent credit ratings can sell their commercial paper at a reasonable price. It is usually sold at a discount from face value and generally has lower interest repayment rates than bonds due to shorter maturities. The longer the maturity on a note, the higher the interest rate the issuing institution pays.\n\nCommercial paper is used to fund operating expenses or current assets rather than financing fixed assets like land, buildings, or machinery. As it qualifies under specific criteria, it does not need to be registered with the u.s. Securities and exchange commission. It is primarily a money-market security and forms part of a continuous rolling program, either a number of years long in europe or open-ended in the united states. \n\n<user> How does the issuance of commercial paper affect the economy and businesses? \n\n<assistant> The issuance of commercial paper can have several effects on the economy and businesses. For businesses, commercial paper provides a cost-effective way to raise short-term funds without relying on traditional bank loans. This helps companies manage their cash flow, finance daily operations, and cover short-term liabilities. Additionally, since commercial paper is issued by large corporations with excellent credit ratings, it provides investors an opportunity to invest in low-risk, short-term securities with potentially better returns than savings accounts or other low-risk investments.\n\nFor the economy, the commercial paper market can play a crucial role in promoting liquidity, as it offers a source of short-term funds for businesses, helping them maintain their operations and manage fluctuating cash flow needs. Moreover, a healthy commercial paper market reflects investors' confidence in the creditworthiness of the issuing corporations, which can boost economic growth. However, any disruption in the commercial paper market, such as a decline in the creditworthiness of issuers or a lack of investor confidence, can lead to decreased liquidity and potentially pose risks to the broader financial system. \n\n<user> Can you share some history and stats on how the commercial paper market has evolved over time? \n\n<assistant> Commercial credit, in the form of promissory notes issued by corporations, can be traced back to at least the 19th century. Marcus goldman, the founder of goldman sachs, started trading commercial paper in new york in 1869.\n\nOver the years, the commercial paper market has grown significantly. At the end of 2009, more than 1,700 companies in the united states issued commercial paper. As of october 31, 2008, the u.s. Federal reserve reported seasonally adjusted figures for the end of 2007, which showed $1.7807 trillion in total outstanding commercial paper. Out of this, $801.3 billion was \"asset-backed\" and $979.4 billion was not; $162.7 billion of the latter was issued by non-financial corporations, and $816.7 billion was issued by financial corporations.\n\nOutside the united states, the international euro-commercial paper market has also evolved, with over $500 billion in outstandings as of the provided information, with instruments denominated predominantly in euros, dollars, and sterling. \n\n<user> With so many options in the financial market like bonds and stocks, why would investors prefer commercial paper? what are potential risks they should be aware of? \n\n<assistant> Investors may prefer commercial paper over other options in the financial market for several reasons:\n\n1. Short-term investment: commercial paper offers a low-risk, short-term investment alternative, making it suitable for investors looking to park their funds for a short period without being committed to longer-term assets.\n\n2. Competitive returns: commercial paper generally offers better returns than other short-term, low-risk investments like savings accounts or certificates of deposit.\n\n3. High credit quality: issued by corporations with high credit ratings, commercial paper typically carries less credit risk compared to investments with lower-rated issuers.\n\n4. Diversification: commercial paper can be a valuable component of an investor's portfolio, allowing for diversification and exposure to different segments of the credit market.\n\nDespite these advantages, investors should be aware of potential risks:\n\n1. Credit risk: commercial paper is not backed by collateral, so the possibility of default still exists. Investors need to evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuer to mitigate this risk.\n\n2. Liquidity risk: although the commercial paper market is generally liquid, instances where investor confidence declines or credit quality deteriorates can lead to reduced liquidity, making it harder to sell the commercial paper at favorable prices.\n\n3. Interest rate risk: changes in market interest rates can affect the returns from commercial paper investments. If interest rates rise, the value of existing commercial paper may decline as newer investments offer higher returns.\n\n4. Limited protections: commercial paper is not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) or any other government agency, meaning investors bear the credit risk without government protections.\n\nBy understanding and managing these risks, investors can optimize the role of commercial paper in their investment portfolios.

        "reference": "Commercial paper, in the global financial market, is an unsecured promissory note with a fixed maturity of rarely more than 270 days. In layperson terms, it is like an \"IOU\" but can be bought and sold because its buyers and sellers have some degree of confidence that it can be successfully redeemed later for cash, based on their assessment of the creditworthiness of the issuing company. \n\nCommercial paper is a money-market security issued by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations (for example, payroll) and is backed only by an issuing bank or company promise to pay the face amount on the maturity date specified on the note.

Commercial paper is usually sold at a discount from face value and generally carries lower interest repayment rates than bonds due to the shorter maturities of commercial paper.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> I'm curious about ergometrine and its uses. how it works and when it is typically used? \n\n<assistant> Ergometrine is a medication commonly used in obstetrics to facilitate the delivery of the placenta and prevent bleeding after childbirth. It achieves this effect by causing contractions of the uterus and narrowing smooth muscle tissue in blood vessel walls, reducing blood flow. The drug can be taken by mouth, injected into a muscle, or administered intravenously, with effects lasting between 45 and 180 minutes.\n\nOften, ergometrine is combined with oxytocin (syntocinon) as syntometrine to enhance its effectiveness. While its primary use is in the delivery process, ergometrine can also be used to diagnose variant (prinzmetal's) angina by inducing coronary artery spasms. \n\n<user> What are the potential side effects and risks of using ergometrine? should people avoid it in certain conditions? \n\n<assistant> Ergometrine, like any medication, comes with potential side effects. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, chest pain, palpitation, bradycardia, transient hypertension, and other cardiac arrhythmias, dyspnea, rashes, and shock. In rare cases, an overdose can lead to ergotism or \"st. Anthony's fire\" which results in prolonged vasospasm, gangrene, amputations, hallucinations, dementia, and abortions.\n\nErgometrine is contraindicated in certain situations, such as during pregnancy, since it can induce uterine contractions that could lead to complications. Additionally, it should not be used in cases of vascular disease and psychosis due to the risk of exacerbating these conditions.\n\nAlways consult a healthcare professional before using ergometrine or any other medication to assess whether it is appropriate for your specific situation. \n\n<user> How was ergometrine discovered? \n\n<assistant> Ergometrine was first discovered in 1932, but its true potential came to light when chemists c moir, h w dudley, and gerald rogers isolated and obtained it in 1935. The pharmacological properties of ergot, from which ergometrine is derived, had been known and utilized by midwives for centuries. However, it wasn't until the 20th century that its properties were thoroughly researched and publicized.\n\nCaroline de costa argues that the adoption of ergometrine for preventive use and the treatment of bleeding after childbirth significantly contributed to the decline in the maternal mortality rate in much of the west during the early 20th century. \n\n<user> What is the connection between ergometrine and lsd? why is ergometrine considered a precursor compound for lsd? \n\n<assistant> Ergometrine and lsd share a common structural component, lysergic acid. Originally, ergometrine was derived from the rye ergot fungus, but it can also be synthesized from lysergic acid. In the synthesis of lsd (lysergic acid diethylamide), lysergic acid is used as a starting material. Because of this relationship between ergometrine and lsd, ergometrine is considered a precursor compound for lsd.\n\nDue to its potential for being used in the illicit production of lsd, ergometrine is listed as a table i precursor under the united nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. This means that its production and distribution are closely monitored and regulated. In the united kingdom, for example, ergometrine is effectively illegal, as it is covered by the misuse of drugs act 1971.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that ergometrine itself has legitimate medical applications, particularly in obstetrics, and is even included in the world health organization's list of essential medicines. Nonetheless, its potential use in the production of illicit substances has led to increased regulation and oversight. ",

Can you tell me more about its main campus and satellite sites? \n\n<assistant> Lincoln college is primarily a further education college situated in lincoln, england. Its main campus is on monks road (b1308), to the north and south of lindum hill (a15), and was previously named lincoln college of technology. The college also has satellite sites across two other locations: gainsborough and newark-on-trent in nottinghamshire. The latter site was established after a merger with the former newark and sherwood college in 2007. These two branch sites are branded as gainsborough college and newark college, respectively. In total, more than 11,000 students are enrolled across the three sites, making lincoln college one of the largest educational establishments in the county of lincolnshire. Unfortunately, the college had to close down its fourth campus, located in louth, lincolnshire, in 2005. \n\n<user> I'd be interested to learn about the historical background of lincoln college. can you provide some information on that? \n\n<assistant> Certainly! Lincoln college has a rich history dating back to the early 20th century. It was initially established as the lincoln technical college and built on cathedral street in 1932. In the early 1970s, the college's name was changed to lincoln college of technology, and it was administered by the city of lincoln education committee. \n\nIn the mid-1980s, the college piloted the technician engineering scholarship scheme (tess) for women, funded by the engineering industry training board. In 1987, lincoln college of technology combined with gainsborough college of further education and a part of louth further education centre to create north lincolnshire college, later known as nlc from 1989. The headquarters were originally on cathedral street until 1993. The college then offered degrees and higher national diplomas (hnds) in conjunction with nottingham trent university, becoming an associate college in 1994. \n\nTowards the late 1990s, the university of lincoln started developing, and lincoln college's student population reached around 15,000. By 2001, the number increased to over 20,000. Due to various reasons, the college changed its name to lincoln college soon after. \n\n<user> What courses do they offer in their automotive technology program? \n\n<assistant> The automotive technology program at lincoln college covers a comprehensive range of topics to provide students with a solid foundation to work in the automotive industry. Some of the key areas of study within the program include training in fuel systems, electrical systems, driving diagnostics, and transmissions. The program also teaches students techniques to install, repair, and maintain vehicles. Typically, programs like this aim to provide both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, ensuring graduates are well-prepared for careers in automotive repair, maintenance, and diagnostics. \n\n<user> Buildings on the main campus of lincoln college and the college's plans for future developments. \n\n<assistant> The main campus of lincoln college comprises eight different buildings: the abbey, gibney, sessions, bishops, and cathedral buildings, among others. Each building serves different purposes and houses various departments. For example, the bishops building, located at the back of the site, contains a technology school that offers electronics courses like the btec national diploma in electrical and electronic engineering.\n\nAn interesting historical tidbit is that the gibney building, part of the college, was the site of the former city school, which was once the lincoln technical school. This site also served as the headquarters of the lincoln archaeological trust in the early 1970s.\n\nAs for future developments, in 2006, lincoln college acquired the site of a former tradex cash-and-carry store. The college planned to transform this site into a multi-purpose drama and music facility, complete with a state-of-the-art theater, recording studios, and rehearsal spaces. The project was slated for completion by the start of the 2007–2008 academic year.

        "dialogue": "\n\n<user> Can you explain to me how complex powers and the failure of some power and logarithm identities are related? \n\n<assistant> Of course! To understand the relationship between complex powers and the failure of some power and logarithm identities, first, you need to know what a complex power is. Complex powers involve raising a complex number to another complex number as the exponent. Calculating complex powers usually requires transforming the numbers to polar or exponential forms.\n\nNow, in real-number domain, there are certain established power and logarithm identities that hold true. However, when dealing with complex numbers, some of these identities fail. This happens mainly because the functions, which are single-valued for real numbers, become multi-valued for complex numbers.\n\nTo give an example of a failed identity, let's consider the identity log(bx) = x⋅log(b) which holds true for positive real numbers b and x. When b is a complex number or if we use the principal branch of the complex logarithm, this identity fails. Regardless of the branch of logarithm used, failures in this identity occur.\n\nAnother example is the identity (bc)x = bxcx, which is valid when b and c are positive real numbers and x is a real number. However, using principal branches and complex numbers, counterexamples can be constructed.\n\nThese failures can be attributed to multiple reasons, including:\n\n1. The multi-valued nature of complex functions: when dealing with complex numbers, many functions become multi-valued, making it difficult to apply some of the established identities correctly.\n\n2.

Let's first briefly understand monoids and matrices.\n\nA monoid is an algebraic structure which consists of a set x and a rule for composition (or \"multiplication\"). The rule satisfies an associative law and contains a multiplicative identity, denoted as 1. Monoids are prevalent across various mathematical structures, such as groups, rings, and fields.\n\nIn the context of matrices and linear operators, if a is a square matrix, the product of a with itself n times is referred to as the matrix power. Also, a^0 is defined as the identity matrix, and if a is invertible, a^(-1) would be its inverse.\n\nNow let's see how exponentiation works with monoids and matrices through an example, in the context of a markov chain.\n\nConsider a simple two-state markov chain that represents the weather pattern, where s1 = \"sunny\" and s2 = \"rainy\". The state transition probabilities are given by:\n\nP(s1 -> s1) = 0.8 (probability of transitioning from sunny to sunny)\nP(s1 -> s2) = 0.2 (sunny to rainy)\nP(s2 -> s1) = 0.3 (rainy to sunny)\nP(s2 -> s2) = 0.7 (rainy to rainy)\n\nThe transition matrix a looks like this:\n\n```\n| 0.8  0.2 |\n|          |\n| 0.3  0.7 |\n```\n\nTo find the probability distribution of weather after t time steps, we can calculate a^t. For example, to find the probability distribution after two days, we can multiply a with itself once (square the matrix a):\n\n```\n| 0.8  0.2 | | 0.8  0.2 |\nA^2 = |          | |          | =\n| 0.3  0.7 | | 0.3  0.7 |\n\n| 0.7  0.26 |\n|           |\n| 0.36 0.64 |\n```\nSo, after two days, the probability of sunny weather (s1) is 0.7, and the probability of rainy weather (s2) is 0.64.\n\nIn this example, we defined the markov chain as a matrix, and exponentiation was used to find the power of that matrix to calculate the probability distribution after a given number of time steps. Matrix exponentiation, like any other exponentiation in monoids, is defined inductively, and the identity element serves as the base case. \n\n<user> Are there any major limitations to using matrix exponentiation in real-life applications? \n\n<assistant> While matrix exponentiation is a powerful tool for modeling certain systems and making predictions, there are some limitations to consider:\n\n1. Applicability: Matrix exponentiation is applicable mainly to linear systems or those which can be linearized as an approximation in a specific range. Some real-world problems can be nonlinear, and algorithms that rely on matrix exponentiation may not accurately model these systems.\n\n2. Computational Complexity: For large matrices, calculating matrix exponentiation can be computationally expensive. Time complexity increases when multiplying large matrices, impacting the efficiency and speed of the calculations.\n\n3. Numerical Stability: When performing matrix exponentiation, the potential for rounding errors and instability might be introduced, particularly with high matrix powers. This can lead to inaccurate results or convergence issues.\n\n4. Sparse matrices: In cases where a matrix is sparse (i.e., most elements are zero), matrix exponentiation can be inefficient. Alternative techniques, like using sparse matrix representations, can provide more efficient ways to perform exponentiation.\n\nDespite these limitations, matrix exponentiation still plays an essential role in many real-life applications, such as Markov chains, graph theory, and network analysis, by providing valuable insights and predictions for various systems.

        "current_turn": "<user> Can you explain to me how complex powers and the failure of some power and logarithm identities are related? \n\n<assistant> Of course! To understand the relationship between complex powers and the failure of some power and logarithm identities, first, you need to know what a complex power is. Complex powers involve raising a complex number to another complex number as the exponent. Calculating complex powers usually requires transforming the numbers to polar or exponential forms.\n\nNow, in real-number domain, there are certain established power and logarithm identities that hold true. However, when dealing with complex numbers, some of these identities fail. This happens mainly because the functions, which are single-valued for real numbers, become multi-valued for complex numbers.\n\nTo give an example of a failed identity, let's consider the identity log(bx) = x⋅log(b) which holds true for positive real numbers b and x. When b is a complex number or if we use the principal branch of the complex logarithm, this identity fails. Regardless of the branch of logarithm used, failures in this identity occur.\n\nAnother example is the identity (bc)x = bxcx, which is valid when b and c are positive real numbers and x is a real number. However, using principal branches and complex numbers, counterexamples can be constructed.\n\nThese failures can be attributed to multiple reasons, including:\n\n1. The multi-valued nature of complex functions: when dealing with complex numbers, many functions become multi-valued, making it difficult to apply some of the established identities correctly.\n\n2. The different branch choices made: the value of a complex power can also depend on the branch chosen to represent the function. This causes an ambiguity in the value calculated using the identity, which could lead to discrepancies.\n\n3. Exponentiation order: changing the order of exponentiation can affect the principal value chosen or the possible values of the complex function, due to the multi-valued nature of complex functions.\n\nDespite the fact that traditional power and logarithm identities might fail in the complex-number domain, these identities are still valid when specific conditions are met, such as when the exponent is an integer, or when dealing with positive real numbers in place of complex numbers.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between complex powers and the failure of some power and logarithm identities is due to the multi-valued nature of complex functions, various branch choices, and the order of exponentiation involved in the operations. These factors lead to discrepancies in the established identities often used in real-number domain calculations.",
